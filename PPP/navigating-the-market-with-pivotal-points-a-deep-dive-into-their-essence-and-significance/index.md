## Jesse Livermore and the Genesis of Pivotal Points

Jesse Livermore, often hailed as one of the greatest traders in history, was a pioneer in the early days of stock trading. His keen observations and insights into market behavior led him to develop the concept of pivotal points. Livermore recognized patterns in stock price movements and realized that certain price levels held significant importance. These levels, which he termed as "pivotal points," became key indicators for potential trend reversals or continuations. Over the years, Livermore's methods have been studied, adapted, and integrated into modern trading strategies, with pivotal points remaining a cornerstone of technical analysis.
