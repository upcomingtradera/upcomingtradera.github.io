Trading is a complex activity that requires a blend of knowledge, skills, and emotional intelligence. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to become a smart trader.

> Day trading involves buying and selling financial instruments within a single trading day.

This means that all positions are closed before the market closes for that particular day. It's a fast-paced environment that requires quick decision-making and a keen eye for market trends.

## Understanding The Characteristics of What Makes a Smart and Successful Day Trader

A smart trader is not just someone who makes profitable trades. It's about making informed decisions, managing risks, and continuously learning and adapting to the market's ever-changing conditions. Here are some key characteristics of a smart trader:
 - **Quick Decision Making**: Day traders need to make split-second decisions based on real-time data.
 - **Knowledge**: A smart trader has a deep understanding of the markets, including the various factors that can influence market movements. This includes both fundamental and technical analysis.
 - **Risk Management**: Smart traders understand that not every trade will be profitable, and they have strategies in place to manage their losses. This includes setting stop-loss orders and only risking a certain percentage of their trading capital on any single trade.
 - **Emotional Control**: Trading can be an emotional rollercoaster, and it's easy to let emotions like fear and greed drive trading decisions. Smart traders are able to control their emotions and make decisions based on logic and strategy, not emotion.
 - **Discipline**: Successful trading requires discipline to stick to your trading plan, even when things don't go as expected. This includes sticking to your trading strategy, not overtrading, and taking breaks when needed.
 - **Continuous Learning**: The markets are constantly changing, and smart traders understand the importance of continuous learning. This includes staying up-to-date with market news, learning new trading strategies, and constantly evaluating and improving their trading performance.

## Challenges a Smart Trader Might Face in Day Trading:

 - **High Stress**: The rapid pace can be stressful, especially when dealing with significant sums of money.
 - **Overtrading**: The urge to make many trades in a day can lead to poor decision-making and potential losses.
 - **Capital Requirements**: Day trading often requires a more substantial capital base than other forms of trading.

## Developing a Smart Trade Plan

A smart trade plan is a comprehensive strategy that outlines your trading goals, risk tolerance, and specific criteria for entering and exiting trades. Here are the five key elements to include in your trade plan:

1. **Your Time Horizon**: How long you plan to hold a stock will depend on your trading strategy. You could be a single-session trader, a swing trader, or a position trader.
2. **Your Entry Strategy**: Look for entry signals—for instance, divergences from trend lines and support levels—to help you place your trades. The signals you employ and the orders you use to make good on them hinge on your trading style and preferences.
3. **Your Exit Plan**: Plan for two types of trades: those that go in your favor and those that don't. You might be tempted to let favorable trades run, but don't ignore opportunities to take some profits. For when a trade moves against you, you can set a stop order at a price below a support level to help manage your risk.
4. **Your Position Size**: Trading is risky. A good trade plan establishes ground rules for how much you're willing to risk on any single trade. Say, for example, you don't want to risk losing more than 2%–3% of your account on a single trade. You could consider exercising portion control, or sizing positions, to fit your budget.
5. **Your Trade Performance**: Are you making or losing money with your trades? And, most importantly, do you understand why? Look over your trading history to calculate your theoretical trade expectancy, meaning your average gain (or loss) per trade.

### Traits of a Successful Futures Trader:

 - **Analytical Skills**: Futures traders need to analyze various factors, from global economic news to specific contract details.
 - **Risk Tolerance**: Understanding one's risk appetite and setting limits accordingly is crucial.
 - **Adaptability**: The futures market can be influenced by a myriad of factors, requiring traders to adapt their strategies frequently.

## Sticking to Your Plan

Even with a solid trade plan, emotions can knock you off course. This is particularly true when a trade goes your way. Being on the winning side of a single trade is great, but far better is to score a series of them. Understanding what goes into a smart trade plan is the first step to prepare you for your next trade.

## The Journey to Smart Trading
Becoming a smart trader is not just about making profitable trades. It's about developing a comprehensive trading plan, managing your risks, controlling your emotions, and continuously learning and improving. With discipline, patience, and the right approach, you can become a smart trader and achieve long-term success in the markets.
