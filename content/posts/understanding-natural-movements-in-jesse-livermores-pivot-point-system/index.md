Jesse Livermore's pivot point system is a renowned method for tracking and predicting stock market movements. Central to this system are the concepts of Natural Rally and Natural Reaction columns. These columns, along with other trend columns, provide traders with a systematic approach to record stock prices and anticipate market trends.

> In the vast tapestry of the stock market, Livermore's Natural Rally and Natural Reaction columns are akin to guiding threads, illuminating the path for traders amidst the market's intricate patterns.

## Recording Prices in Trend Columns
Trend columns serve as the backbone of Jesse Livermore's {{< linktopost url="natural-movements-in-jesse-livermores-pivot-point-system" alt="pivot point" >}} system, offering a structured and systematic approach to capturing stock market movements. By differentiating between upward and downward trends using distinct ink colors, traders can visually grasp the market's direction at a glance.

Meanwhile, the use of pencil in other columns provides flexibility, allowing for adjustments based on evolving market conditions. This method of recording not only simplifies the tracking process but also aids in quick decision-making, ensuring that traders remain agile and informed in the dynamic world of stock trading.
### Upward and Downward Trends
 - **Upward Trend**: Prices in this column are recorded in black ink, representing a positive market movement.
 - **Downward Trend**: Prices here are marked in red ink, indicating a negative market trajectory.
### Other Columns
 - Prices in the remaining four columns are recorded using a pencil. These columns capture more nuanced market movements and are crucial for understanding natural rallies and reactions.

## Drawing Lines to Understand Market Movements
In the intricate dance of the stock market, understanding the rhythm and flow of price movements is paramount. Drawing lines, as prescribed in Jesse Livermore's pivot point system, acts as a visual guide, helping traders and analysts decode the market's narrative. These lines, whether red or black, underscore significant price points, signaling potential shifts in market momentum.

By meticulously marking these pivotal junctures, traders can gain deeper insights into the market's trajectory, enabling them to anticipate and respond to potential trends and reversals more effectively.

### Natural Reaction
 - **Red Lines in Upward Trend**: Draw red lines under the last recorded price in the Upward Trend column when you begin recording in the Natural Reaction column. This starts after a reaction of approximately six points from the last price in the Upward Trend column.
 - **Transition to Natural Rally or Upward Trend**: Draw red lines under the last price in the Natural Reaction column when you start recording in the Natural Rally or Upward Trend columns. This begins after a rally of about six points from the last price in the Natural Reaction column.

### Natural Rally
 - **Black Lines in Downward Trend**: Draw black lines under the last recorded price in the Downward Trend column when you start recording in the Natural Rally column. This starts after a rally of approximately six points from the last price in the Downward Trend column.
 - **Transition to Natural Reaction or Downward Trend**: Draw black lines under the last price in the Natural Rally column when you begin recording in the Natural Reaction or Downward Trend columns. This begins after a reaction of about six points from the last price in the Natural Rally column.

## Pivotal Points and Their Significance
Two pivotal points emerge from the above recording methods. These points become crucial when the market returns to their vicinity. Depending on the recording of prices around these points, traders can form opinions on whether the positive trend will resume or if the movement has concluded.
### Key Price Recording
The rules for recording in the Key Price column are similar to individual stocks, but the basis is twelve points instead of six.

## Explanatory Rules and Pivotal Points
The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend columns becomes a pivotal point as soon as you start recording in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns. After a rally or reaction concludes, recording resumes in the reverse column, and the extreme price in the previous column becomes another pivotal point. These pivotal points, highlighted with double lines, are instrumental in anticipating significant market movements.

## The Power of Natural Movements in Stock Recording
Understanding the Natural Rally and Natural Reaction columns is pivotal in the context of stock recording. They represent the stock's natural movements, free from external influences, and provide traders with a clear picture of the market's direction.

By meticulously recording prices and observing the pivotal points, traders can make informed decisions and anticipate market trends with greater accuracy. Jesse Livermore's pivot point system, with its emphasis on natural movements, remains a timeless tool for traders worldwide.
