# Making Sense of the 1-2-3 Trading Rule

The 1-2-3 trading rule is a classic price pattern used in trading reversals. It's a simple yet powerful strategy that can help traders predict potential reversals in the market. This rule is based on the formation of three pivot points in the price chart, hence the name 1-2-3.

## Understanding the 1-2-3 Trading Rule

The 1-2-3 trading rule is a three-wave formation, where every move reaches a pivot point. These pivot points are the key elements of the 1-2-3 tradin rule. The pattern is named after these three pivot points. The pattern is quite common and appears at the beginning of many price reversals.

1. **Pivot Point 1**: This is the turning point during a trend. The beginning of every trend correction is a potential Pivot Point 1. If the 1-2-3 chart pattern is valid, then the price is very likely to break its previous trend line after creating Pivot Point 1.

2. **Pivot Point 2**: The next turning point is very likely to form outside of the previous trendline or channel. This is a good indication that the trend might be ready to end and reverse.

3. **Pivot Point 3**: Pivot Point 3 is crucial for the confirmation of the 1-2-3 reversal chart pattern. The reason for this is that it is the last component of the setup. In a valid 1-2-3 reversal pattern, that point would not exceed Pivot Point 1. Worst-case scenario, it would be at the same level. Pivot Point 3 moving close to Pivot Point 1, but not reaching it is an indication of a stronger 1-2-3 reversal pattern setup.

The confirmation level is the area, which tells us “Hey! This might be a good opportunity to enter the market based on a valid 1-2-3 reversal!” Its location is at the same level as Pivot Point 2. If the price breaks this level, then the pattern is said to be confirmed.

## Applying the 1-2-3 Trading Rule

When applying the 1-2-3 trading rule, traders enter a position as the market breaks the level of Pivot Point 2. The stop-loss order is placed at Pivot Point 3. The target level during a 1-2-3 trade should be at a distance equal to the size of the 1-2-3 chart pattern. Applying it from the start of the confirmation level will give you your approximate target level.

The 1-2-3 trading setup combines well with a technical oscillator. The reason for this is that oscillators can help signal extreme values, which can provide confirmation of trend reversals. For example, if we have a bullish trend and the chart is forming a potential 1-2-3 reversal pattern, we will be looking for an overbought signal from the RSI. This way we will attain a stronger reversal signal, which is likely to bring a higher success rate for our pattern.

## Conclusion

The 1-2-3 trading rule is a powerful tool for predicting potential reversals in the market. By understanding and applying this rule, traders can make more informed decisions and potentially increase their chances of successful trades. However, like all trading strategies, it's important to use it in conjunction with other tools and indicators to maximize its effectiveness.g
