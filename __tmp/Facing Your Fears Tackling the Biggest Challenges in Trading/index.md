# Facing Your Fears: Tackling the Biggest Challenges in Trading

Trading, like any other profession, comes with its own set of fears and challenges. The fear of losing money, the fear of being wrong, the fear of missing out, and the fear of leaving money on the table are some of the most common fears that traders face. 

## Fear of Losing Money

The fear of losing money is often the biggest fear for traders. This fear can lead to overexposure of their position and inability to deal with losses. It's paradoxical that trading is about risking money to make more money and many traders are not mature enough to contain losses or able to cap losses in a way that they can live with. By not having the right trading plan and tolerance towards losing money, a trader can develop a fear of losing money, which can create a fear of entering the market at the right time. Missing the best entry because you doubted yourself could be a crippling habit to fall into. This might lead to placing a very low investment, and the profits will not be significant. The weight that traders who experience this fear put on losing money is greater than the satisfaction that ultimately comes with earning profits.

## Fear of Being Wrong

This basic trader’s fear is generally a feeling people face towards their analysis. This usually manifests itself in fear of taking action. Traders enter a trade in a less confident way, and when the market starts to jiggle and play tricks, the lack of confidence grows stronger and makes traders resort to hasty and poorly thought-out decisions. Traders might exit the trade prematurely, not trusting their technical analysis, etc. This can often be related to the recency effect, a feeling wherein traders tell themselves that they can’t have another loss. This fear can have devastating effects on your decision-making abilities.

## Fear of Missing Out

The fear of missing out on an opportunity is another main catalyst for bad trading decisions. A trader might take an opportunity prematurely or post-maturely. For example, this is like seeing a strong movement in the market and saying, “I knew it, I should have been there!” then jumping in and suffering the ranging fluctuation, which puts you in a very stressful trade. You can also enter prematurely and then hold on to the trade in agony while the price moves towards the actual confirmation. If this happens on a live trade, you could find yourself suffering from drawdown and holding.

## Fear of Leaving Money on the Table

The final big fear traders face is seeing their profitable trades retrace on them and having the entire profit eaten up. The result is that you end up taking short and low profits on a trade. Another side of this is that a trader would not take profits at the right time and instead tell themselves that the price will go up in the future and then take the money out. In this scenario, the price can work against you, resulting in breaking even or even taking a loss.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, you need to know that you’re in it for the long run, not for short, quick gains. Successful, sustainable trading is a marathon, not a sprint. You’ll never be able to take the full potential of every move in the market, and you need to adjust your expectations to allow for this reality. As with any fear, it’s ultimately up to you how to avoid and or cope with it. If you know the warning signs and can see the traps laid out beforehand, you’ll have a much easier time avoiding them and dealing with their effects should you fall victim to them.
