# Reality Check: What Percentage of Futures Traders Make Money?

The success rate of futures traders is a topic of interest for many, especially those considering entering the field. Various sources provide different perspectives on this issue, but the consensus seems to be that a significant percentage of futures traders do not make money consistently.

## What the Statistics Say

According to a study by Brad Barber of the University of California, Davis, only 1% of day traders consistently make money[^1^]. This study analyzed trades from 1992 to 2006, a span of fourteen years. The few people who do make money consistently spend their days trading, and it becomes their full-time job instead of something they do between meetings or at lunch.

Another source, the Data Science Society, states that approximately 1–20% of day traders actually profit from their endeavors[^2^]. This means that between 80 and 99 percent of them fail. The site also mentions that day trading has a 4% success rate as a source of income. The actual rate observed during many years of trading at a proprietary trading firm and in discussions with other firm operators was that 10% to 15% of prop firm trainees could make some money through day trading (a side activity). For many, their earnings were insufficient to warrant their time.

A report on Tradeciety.com suggests that 80% of all day traders quit within the first two years[^3^]. Among all day traders, nearly 40% day trade for only one month. Within three years, only 13% continue to day trade. After five years, only 7% remain. The site also mentions that profitable day traders make up a small proportion of all traders – 1.6% in the average year. However, these day traders are very active – accounting for 12% of all day trading activity.

## Conclusion

The statistics suggest that a significant percentage of futures traders do not make money. However, it's important to note that these statistics do not necessarily mean that futures trading is inherently unprofitable. Rather, they highlight the challenges and difficulties associated with this type of trading. Successful futures trading requires a combination of knowledge, skill, discipline, and patience. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, and those who approach it as such are likely to be disappointed.
