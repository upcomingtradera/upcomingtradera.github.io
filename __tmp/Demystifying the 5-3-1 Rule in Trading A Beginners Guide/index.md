# Follow the Numbers: Demystifying the 531 Trading Rule

The 5-3-1 trading rule is a simple guide used by traders, particularly in the forex market, to help establish the best trading plan for their own style. This strategy is especially beneficial for new traders who may be overwhelmed by the multitude of currency pairs available and the 24/7 nature of the market. The numbers 5, 3, and 1 in the 5-3-1 trading rule stand for:

## Five Currency Pairs

The first part of the 5-3-1 trading strategy suggests that traders should focus on only five major currency pairs. The pairs chosen should concentrate on one or two major currencies with which the trader is most familiar. For instance, if a trader resides in Australia, they may choose AUD/USD, AUD/NZD, EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD, and AUD/JPY. By focusing on only five pairs, traders can gain a deep understanding of how these pairs move.

## Three Trading Strategies

Next, traders should select a maximum of three specific strategies to use when trading. This limit applies both to the trading style chosen and the indicators employed with technical analysis. Keeping the trading plan focused on just three specific strategies allows traders to concentrate their technical analysis on specific timeframes that best fit with their chosen indicators. It also ensures traders don't become confused by using too many indicators to the extent they begin to contradict each other and show mixed signals.

The number three can be further broken down into three components:

1. First, pick a specific trading style that aligns best with your goals. This could be carry trading, scalping, news trading, swing trading, etc.
2. Then, choose a few indicators that work best with your chosen style. Moving average-based indicators like the MACD and Stochastic Oscillator work well for day trading, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is popular among momentum traders.
3. Finally, decide on a risk management strategy that best fits your style. You may prefer to set close stop-loss and limit orders to lock in small profit gains and prevent losses, or you can use trailing stops to capture gains during long-term momentum trades.

## One Trading Time

The last part of the 5-3-1 strategy suggests that traders should only trade at one time, the same time every day. One of the biggest draws to the forex market is its 24/7 availability. However, failing to log in to your trading account on schedule will guarantee you miss trading opportunities, or the market will move against you without your knowledge. The time you pick to trade should be when the currency pairs you've chosen to trade are most active.

In conclusion, the 5-3-1 trading rule is a structured approach to trading that can help traders, especially beginners, to navigate the complex world of forex trading. By focusing on a limited number of currency pairs, employing a select few trading strategies, and trading at a consistent time each day, traders can potentially enhance their trading performance and manage their risks effectively.
