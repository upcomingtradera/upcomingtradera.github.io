**Easy Trading: A Guide to the Simplest Trades You Can Make**

When it comes to trading, especially for beginners, simplicity is key. The easiest trades are often those that require the least amount of complex analysis and can be understood with basic research and knowledge. Based on the information from the provided sources, let's explore what could be considered the easiest trade for beginners.

**Futures Trading: An Accessible Starting Point**

Futures trading is often considered an attractive market for beginners due to its potential for high returns and the relatively low capital required to get started. However, the 'easiness' of a trade can depend on the specific futures contract you choose to trade.

**Choosing the Right Futures Contract**

When choosing a futures contract for day trading, three main factors should be considered: volume, margins, and movement. 

1. **Volume**: Contracts that typically trade more than 300,000 contracts in a day are recommended. High volume ensures liquidity, which allows you to buy and sell at the levels you want.

2. **Margins**: Day trading margins vary by broker and contract. Lower margins mean you need less capital in your account to start trading. 

3. **Movement**: The movement of the contract should align with your trading style. Some contracts are more volatile than others, meaning they can have larger price swings within a trading day.

**E-Mini S&P 500: A Beginner-Friendly Contract**

As of April 2020, the E-Mini S&P 500 (ES) futures contract was one of the most heavily traded contracts. It also has a relatively low day trading margin requirement, making it accessible for beginners with smaller accounts. 

The E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract is based on the S&P 500 Index, which is a broad and widely followed index. This means that even beginners can easily follow the news and events that might impact the index's direction.

**Learning and Practicing**

The best way to learn futures trading is to use a demo account with a real brokerage, also known as "paper trading". This allows you to gain experience and learn the ins and outs of the brokerage software without risking real money. Once you're comfortable with your strategy, you can open a real account and fund it with real dollars.

In conclusion, while the 'easiest' trade can vary depending on individual knowledge and comfort with different markets, the E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract is often considered a good starting point for beginners due to its high volume, low margin requirement, and the accessibility of information about the S&P 500 Index. However, it's important to remember that all trading involves risk, and it's crucial to do your research and practice before diving in.
