# The Biggest Fear in Trading: An Industry-wide Study

Fear is a common emotion experienced by traders. It can manifest in various forms and can significantly impact trading decisions and outcomes. Here are the most common fears that traders face:

## Fear of Being Wrong

This fear is often associated with a trader's analysis. It can lead to hesitation in taking action, resulting in less confident trade entries. When the market starts to fluctuate, this lack of confidence can grow stronger, leading to hasty and poorly thought-out decisions, such as prematurely exiting a trade or not trusting one's technical analysis. This fear can also stem from a feeling of commitment to family or significant others, where the trader fears having to admit to them about a loss. This fear can lead to poor trading decisions, such as prematurely moving stops based on emotions rather than market changes, averaging down, revenge trading, or deviating from the trading plan.

## Fear of Losing Money

This fear is particularly prevalent among traders who overexpose their positions and struggle to deal with losses. The paradox of trading is that it involves risking money to make more money, and not all traders are mature enough to handle losses. This fear can lead to hesitation in entering the market at the right time, leading to missed opportunities or low-profit trades. Traders who fear losing money often turn to third-party solutions rather than looking inward for solutions.

## Fear of Missing Out

The fear of missing out on an opportunity can lead to poor trading decisions, such as prematurely entering or exiting a trade. For example, a trader might see a strong market movement and jump in, only to suffer from the fluctuating market. Alternatively, a trader might enter a trade prematurely and then hold onto the trade while the price moves towards the actual confirmation, leading to drawdown and holding.

## Fear of Leaving Money on the Table

This fear arises when traders see their profitable trades retrace and their profits diminish. This can lead to taking short and low profits on a trade. On the other hand, a trader might not take profits at the right time, hoping that the price will go up in the future. This can result in breaking even or even taking a loss if the price moves against them.

Overcoming these fears involves understanding and acknowledging them, having a solid trading plan, and sticking to it. It's important to remember that successful, sustainable trading is a marathon, not a sprint. You'll never be able to take the full potential of every market move, and adjusting your expectations to this reality is crucial. As with any fear, it's ultimately up to you how to avoid or cope with it. If you know the warning signs and can see the traps laid out beforehand, you'll have a much easier time avoiding them and dealing with their effects should you fall victim to them.
