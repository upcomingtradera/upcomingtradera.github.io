# Day Trading Success: How Many People Really Make it?

Day trading, the practice of buying and selling financial instruments within the same day, has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. However, the success rate of day traders is a topic of much debate and research. The internet is filled with stories of day traders making huge profits, but the reality is that the majority of day traders do not achieve consistent profitability. 

## The Reality of Day Trading Success

According to a study by Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean, published in the Journal of Financial Markets, only about 1% to 3% of day traders are able to consistently earn above-market returns. This study, which analyzed the trading data from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, found that the most active traders tended to lose the most money. 

Another study, published on the blog Gitnux, found that only 13% of day traders were consistently profitable over a period of five years or more. This study also highlighted that the majority of day traders lose money, with the average day trader losing money on 97% of days.

A study by Chague, De-Losso, and Giovannetti, published on SSRN, analyzed the performance of new day traders on the Brazilian equity futures market from 2012-2017. They found that only 17 individuals out of 1,500 traders earned more than the Brazilian minimum wage, net of fees.

## Factors Influencing Day Trading Success

The success of day trading is influenced by several factors. These include the trader's level of experience and sophistication, their access to high-quality information and trading tools, and their ability to react quickly to market changes. 

However, even among the most experienced and sophisticated traders, the success rate is low. The studies suggest that profitable day trading is extremely difficult and requires a level of skill and knowledge that most individuals do not possess. 

## The Bottom Line

While there are certainly individuals who have achieved success in day trading, these individuals represent a very small percentage of all day traders. The majority of day traders do not achieve consistent profitability, and many lose money. As such, day trading should be approached with caution, and individuals should be aware of the risks involved before they begin trading.
