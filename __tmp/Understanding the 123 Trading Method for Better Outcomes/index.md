# Understanding the 1-2-3 Rule in Trading

The 1-2-3 rule, also known as the 1-2-3 reversal pattern, is a fundamental technical analysis tool used by traders to identify potential trend reversals in financial markets. This pattern is formed when there are three consecutive price swings, with each swing being higher or lower than the previous one.

## The 1-2-3 Pattern Setup

The 1-2-3 chart pattern is a three-wave formation, where every move reaches a pivot point. The first swing (number "1") represents a move in the opposite direction of the current trend, followed by a correction (swing number "2"). The third and final swing (number "3") confirms that a new trend has begun once it breaks the support/resistance (S/R) zone, which can be either bullish or bearish depending on whether the last swing was up or down.

The pattern consists of three pivot points:

1. **Pivot Point 1:** This is the turning point during a trend. The beginning of every trend correction is a potential Pivot Point 1. If the 1-2-3 chart pattern is valid, then the price is very likely to break its previous trend line after creating Pivot Point 1.

2. **Pivot Point 2:** The next turning point is very likely to form outside of the previous trendline or channel. This is a good indication that the trend might be ready to end and reverse.

3. **Pivot Point 3:** Pivot Point 3 is crucial for the confirmation of the 1-2-3 reversal chart pattern. The reason for this is that it is the last component of the setup. In a valid 1-2-3 reversal pattern, that point would not exceed Pivot Point 1. Worst-case scenario, it would be at the same level. Pivot Point 3 moving close to Pivot Point 1, but not reaching it is an indication of a stronger 1-2-3 reversal pattern setup.

## Trading the 1-2-3 Pattern

To effectively use this three-wave formation for trading decisions, traders need to understand its basic components and use additional technical analysis tools. For instance, trend indicators can help identify possible support and resistance levels within the pattern, aiding the decision-making process when it comes to entering trades based on this particular chart formation.

The confirmation of the 1-2-3 reversal pattern lays at Pivot Point 2. If the price breaks this level, then the pattern is said to be confirmed. The target when trading a 1-2-3 formation is at a distance equal to the size of the pattern, applied beyond Pivot Point 2. Your stop loss should go beyond Pivot Point 3.

The 1-2-3 reversal chart pattern combines well with a technical oscillator, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI Indicator), to provide confirmation of trend reversals. The idea is to match a reversal signal from the 1-2-3 reversal setup with a reversal signal from an oscillator indicator.

## The 1-2-3 Pattern as a Continuation

Although the 1-2-3 chart setup is typically seen as a reversal, it could also act as a continuation pattern. In other words, it could give a signal that the trend is not reversing. Instead, we might be looking at a flatter correction, which could trigger a new move in the same direction. If the price fails to break the level at Pivot Point 2, or breaks it slightly and then reverses quickly, then this was most likely a flatter correction. The breakout in Pivot Point 3 will give a signal that the trend is resuming.

In conclusion, the 1-2-3 rule in trading is a powerful tool for identifying potential trend reversals or continuations. By understanding and applying this rule, traders can make more informed decisions and potentially increase their chances of successful trades.
