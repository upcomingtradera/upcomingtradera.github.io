## Day Traders In Late 1800 to Mid 1900s
Jesse Lauriston Livermore (1877-1940). He was an American stock trader and investor who gained a reputation as one of the most successful traders in history. Livermore's life and career were marked by dramatic ups and downs, which included making and losing multiple fortunes.


## In Day Trading Context Matters
There are a few types of market participants:
- Hedgers
  - [ ] Market participants, such as farmers or manufacturers, use futures to protect themselves against price fluctuations in the underlying assets. For example, a farmer might sell wheat futures to lock in a specific price, reducing the risk of potential price drops in the future.
- Speculators
  - [ ] Traders and investors use futures to speculate on the future price movements of the underlying assets. They aim to profit from the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time of settlement.
- Arbitrage Traders
  - [ ] Arbitrage trading strategy involves taking advantage of price discrepancies between two or more related financial instruments or markets to generate risk-free profits. In the context of futures trading, arbitrage opportunities can arise due to mispricing between the futures contract and its underlying asset or between different futures contracts.

> It's important to note that the term "day trader" did not exist during his time.

While Jesse Livermore's trading style shares some similarities with modern-day trading, it's important to note that the term "day trader" did not exist during his time. Livermore was a speculator who primarily focused on short-term price movements and made quick trading decisions. He would sometimes hold positions for a few days or weeks, depending on the market trend and his analysis.

In today's context, Livermore could be considered an early form of a day trader, as he sought to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations in the market. However, it's crucial to recognize that trading during Livermore's era was very different from today's electronic and high-speed trading environment.

### Jesse Livermore A Day Trader In A Week Or Less
While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact duration of all his positions during this time, it is clear that Livermore held some of his short positions for a week or less during the crash, taking advantage of the rapid and dramatic decline in stock prices. This ability to capitalize on short-term price movements was a key characteristic of Livermore's trading style.

One notable example of Jesse Livermore holding a position for a short period, close to a week, is during the 1929 stock market crash. Livermore correctly predicted that the stock market was in a dangerous bubble and began short-selling stocks in anticipation of the upcoming crash.

It is important to remember the context that during his time, a week was an extremely short turnaround period for trading and so keeping context in mind. In reference to the question, "Was Jesse Livermore a Day Trader" the answer can be said to be yes. He is considered a pioneer of day trading.
