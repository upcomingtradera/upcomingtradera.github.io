# Futures Practice Account: The Key to Mastering Futures Trading

Futures trading can be a complex and risky endeavor. However, with the right tools and practice, you can master the art of futures trading. One such tool is a futures practice account, which allows you to simulate trading futures without risking real money. Here are some of the top futures practice accounts available online:

## CME Group's Trading Simulator

[CME Group](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/practice.html) offers a range of tools for futures traders, including a trading simulator. This tool allows you to study the charts, add your indicators, test your strategies, and manage your account, all for free. The platform also offers other tools such as the CME Liquidity Tool for analyzing current and historical bid-ask spreads, and the Strategy Simulator for learning how an option contract, futures contract, or physical position will perform based on different hypothetical underlying price scenarios.

## RJO Futures' Demo Account

[RJO Futures](https://rjofutures.rjobrien.com/online-trading-platforms/rjofuturespro/demo) provides a futures trading demo account that offers access to an exclusive and sophisticated online trading platform. The platform includes features such as free 100K simulated futures trading with live market data & execution, one-click trading from charts, price ladder (DOM) & order ticket screens, and alerts based on price, study, or time that can trigger order placement. The demo account is free for RJO Futures Clients, but it's also available for a free demo trial.

## NinjaTrader's Trading Simulator

[NinjaTrader](https://ninjatrader.com/trading-platform/trading-simulator/) offers a free trading simulator that allows you to simulate your trades in real-time. It provides a comprehensive trading experience with advanced charting, market analytics, automated strategy development, and trade simulation. The platform also offers extensive historical market data for backtesting your strategies.

Unfortunately, the content from Tradovate's simulated trading and United Futures' simulated trading could not be retrieved. 

These practice accounts can provide invaluable experience and insight into the futures market, helping you to develop effective trading strategies and understand market dynamics without risking real capital. Remember, while practice accounts can mimic real market conditions, they cannot fully replicate the psychological pressures that come with actual trading. Therefore, always proceed with caution when transitioning from a practice account to live trading.
