# Success in Trading: A Look at Successful Trader Statistics

Trading is a challenging profession that requires a combination of skill, discipline, and strategic planning. While many people attempt to become professional traders, only a small percentage succeed. Here's a look at the statistics behind successful trading.

## The Reality of Trading Success Rates

According to a study by Brad Barber of the University of California, Davis, only 1% of day traders consistently make money. This study, which analyzed trades from 1992 to 2006, found that successful day trading is not a part-time endeavor but a full-time job. Those who make money consistently spend their days trading, and it becomes their primary occupation instead of something they do between meetings or at lunch [^1^].

Another source suggests that only 13% of day traders were consistently profitable over a year, and only 1% of day traders were consistently profitable over a period of five years or more [^2^].

A different study suggests that the day trading success rate is around 4% for those who can make a living from the markets. This study also suggests that the success rate could be between 10% and 15% for those who can make some money through day trading as a side activity [^3^].

However, it's important to note that these statistics can vary widely depending on the source. For example, a report from the Data Science Society suggests that between 1â€“20% of day traders actually profit from their endeavors, meaning that between 80 and 99 percent of them fail [^4^].

Finally, a Business Insider article states that only six percent of the people who attempt to become professional traders actually succeed [^5^].

## Factors Affecting Success in Trading

Several factors can affect a trader's success, including:

1. **Passion**: Traders who enjoy the process of trading are more likely to succeed than those who are only in it for the money.

2. **Education**: Successful traders often have a solid understanding of the markets and trading strategies.

3. **Planning**: Having a trading business plan can help traders stay accountable and focused on their strategy.

4. **Testing**: Traders need to backtest and forward test their strategies to build confidence and ensure their viability.

5. **Psychology**: The ability to manage emotions and maintain discipline is crucial in trading.

6. **Capital**: Like any business, trading requires capital. Traders who start with insufficient funds may struggle to stay in the game long enough to become profitable.

In conclusion, while the percentage of successful traders may seem low, it's important to remember that trading is a skill that can be developed with time, effort, and the right approach. Those who are willing to invest in their education, develop a solid trading plan, and practice discipline may increase their chances of becoming part of the successful minority.
