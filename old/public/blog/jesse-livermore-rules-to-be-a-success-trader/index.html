<p>Jesse Livermore&rsquo;s trading rules are derived from his trading principles and reflect his experiences and lessons learned throughout his career. These rules can serve as a guideline for traders and investors, but it&rsquo;s essential to remember that they should be adapted to individual risk tolerance, trading style, and market conditions.</p>
<h3 id="jesses-early-career-and-learning">Jesse&rsquo;s Early Career And Learning</h3>
<p>Livermore began working in stock brokerage offices at the age of 14 as a board boy. He was responsible for posting stock quotes on the chalkboard, which allowed him to observe price movements and develop an early understanding of market trends.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-bucket-shops-and-how-they-operated">What Are Bucket Shops And How They Operated</h3>
<p>Bucket shops, also known as &ldquo;bucketeers,&rdquo; were establishments that operated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. They allowed customers to bet on stock price movements without actually buying or selling the stocks themselves. These establishments were distinct from legitimate stock exchanges and brokerages, as they did not execute actual trades on an exchange.</p>
<p>In a bucket shop, customers would place bets on whether the price of a particular stock would go up or down. The bucket shop would act as the counterparty to these bets, taking the opposite side of the customer&rsquo;s position. In essence, the bucket shop was betting against its customers, and its profits came from the difference between the winning and losing bets.</p>
<p>Bucket shops often attracted novice investors and traders who sought to make quick profits from stock market speculation with minimal capital. However, these establishments were notorious for fraudulent practices, such as manipulating stock prices or not paying out on winning bets. Bucket shops were eventually banned in the United States due to these unethical practices and their contribution to market instability.</p>
<p>Jesse Livermore started his trading career in bucket shops, where he honed his skills in reading price movements and patterns. However, as he gained experience and capital, he transitioned to trading on legitimate stock exchanges, where he built his reputation as a successful trader.</p>
