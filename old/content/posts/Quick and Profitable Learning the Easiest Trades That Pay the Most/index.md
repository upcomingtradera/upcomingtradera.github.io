# Quick and Profitable: Learning the Easiest Trades That Pay the Most

Trading can be a complex and intimidating field, with numerous strategies, markets, and instruments to choose from. However, some trades are easier to learn and can yield significant profits. This article will focus on futures trading, which is often considered one of the most accessible and profitable forms of trading.

## Understanding Futures Trading

A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a particular security or commodity at a future date. These contracts were originally established to help farmers and other commodity producers hedge risk in the future. Today, futures contracts enable investors to take a position on the future value or price of a variety of assets, from physical commodities like gold and corn to financial instruments like stock indices and cryptocurrencies.

Futures trading is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the U.S., with many duties delegated to the industryâ€™s self-regulating body, the National Futures Association. Futures are traded on exchanges, which create the contracts, maintain orderly markets, guarantee performance on the contracts, and publish market data.

## The Best Futures to Trade

According to various sources, some of the best futures contracts for day trading include the E-mini S&P 500, E-mini NASDAQ-100, E-mini Dow Jones, and the E-mini Russell 2000. These contracts are popular due to their high liquidity and tight bid-ask spreads, which can lead to lower trading costs.

In terms of profitability, the E-mini S&P 500 is often cited as one of the most profitable futures contracts. This is due to its high liquidity and volatility, which can create numerous trading opportunities.

## The Best Platforms for Futures Trading

Choosing the right platform is crucial for successful futures trading. The best futures trading platforms for 2023, according to StockBrokers.com, include Interactive Brokers, tastytrade, TD Ameritrade, TradeStation, and E*TRADE. These platforms were chosen based on their pricing, investment choices, trading tools, research, usability, and available order types.

Interactive Brokers is recommended for professional futures trading, while tastytrade is best for casual futures traders. TD Ameritrade offers the best desktop futures trading platform, TradeStation provides great platforms and low commissions, and E*TRADE is the best trading platform for beginners.

## Learning to Trade Futures

There are numerous resources available for those interested in learning to trade futures. Online courses, such as those offered on Udemy, can provide step-by-step instructions on how to trade futures, focusing on popular markets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These courses often cover topics like risk management, platform usage, and practical trading strategies.

## Conclusion

While futures trading can be risky and is not suitable for everyone, it can also be a profitable venture for those who take the time to learn the ins and outs of the market. By choosing the right futures contracts and platforms, and by investing in education and risk management, traders can potentially reap significant rewards from futures trading. As always, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and all trading involves risk.
