# Which Broker Offers 20X Leverage? A Comparative Study

## XM

XM is a well-known broker that offers high leverage up to 888:1. However, this is only for traders outside of the European Union. For traders within the EU, the maximum leverage is capped at 30:1 due to ESMA regulations. XM offers a wide range of trading instruments including forex, CFDs on stocks, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies.

## FXTM

FXTM, also known as ForexTime, offers leverage up to 1000:1. Like XM, this high leverage is only available to traders outside of the European Union. FXTM offers a wide range of trading instruments including forex, CFDs on stocks, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies.

## Exness

Exness offers unlimited leverage, which essentially means you can trade with as much leverage as you want, as long as you have the necessary margin in your account. This is a unique offering in the industry and can be very attractive to certain types of traders. Exness offers a wide range of trading instruments including forex, CFDs on stocks, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies.

## HotForex

HotForex offers leverage up to 1000:1. This broker offers a wide range of trading instruments including forex, CFDs on stocks, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies.

## SAMCO

SAMCO is an Indian broker that offers up to 100X leverage for futures and options intraday trading, up to 33X leverage for equity intraday trading, and up to 80X leverage for commodity intraday trading. However, for options stocks/indices trading, SAMCO offers up to 20X leverage using their OptionPlus subscription.

In conclusion, while many brokers offer high leverage, the exact amount can vary depending on the broker, the type of trading instrument, and the trader's location due to regulatory restrictions. It's also important to note that while trading with high leverage can amplify profits, it can also amplify losses. Therefore, it's crucial for traders to understand the risks involved and to use leverage responsibly.
