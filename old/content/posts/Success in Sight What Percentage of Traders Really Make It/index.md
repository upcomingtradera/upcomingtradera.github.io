# Success in Sight: What Percentage of Traders Really Make It

## Introduction

Trading, particularly day trading, is a challenging endeavor that requires a combination of knowledge, skill, and psychological resilience. The percentage of traders who actually make it, i.e., become consistently profitable, is a topic of interest for many. This article synthesizes information from various sources to provide a comprehensive answer.

## The Hard Facts

According to a study by the Data Science Society, the majority of day traders fail, with estimates suggesting that about 99% of them do not succeed[^1^]. This is corroborated by a report from Quantified Strategies, which indicates that most day traders fail due to a lack of discipline, poor risk management, and overtrading[^2^].

Finmasters provides a more nuanced perspective, stating that while many traders do lose money, the percentage of profitable day traders can vary depending on the time frame considered[^3^]. For instance, about 17% of day traders are profitable after a year, but this figure drops to around 7% after five years.

Trade That Swing, a proprietary trading firm, offers an insider's perspective. Based on their experience and conversations with other firm operators, they estimate that the success rate for trainees becoming consistently profitable traders is extremely low. Out of approximately 2,000 traders who came through their doors, only about 4% managed to make a living from day trading. The success rate, including people who were slightly profitable but couldnâ€™t make enough to live off, was likely around 10% to 15%[^4^].

Wealth Within, an Australian trading education company, suggests that over time, 80% of traders lose money, 10% break even, and only 10% make money consistently[^5^]. They attribute the high failure rate to a lack of knowledge, unrealistic expectations, and psychological factors.

## Conclusion

The percentage of traders who actually make it is relatively small, with estimates ranging from 4% to 10% for those who can make a living from trading. The success rate increases slightly when considering traders who make some profit but not enough to live off. However, it's important to note that these figures can vary depending on the time frame and the specific criteria used to define "success."

While the odds may seem daunting, it's important to remember that trading is a skill that can be learned and improved over time. Successful trading requires a combination of knowledge, disciplined strategy application, risk management, and psychological resilience. Aspiring traders should be prepared for the challenges and be committed to continuous learning and improvement.
