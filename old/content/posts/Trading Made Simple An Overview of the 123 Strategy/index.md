# Trading Made Simple: An Overview of the 123 Strategy

The 123 strategy, also known as the 123 reversal pattern strategy, is a common technical analysis tool used by traders to identify potential trend reversals in financial markets. This pattern is formed when there are three consecutive price swings, with each swing being higher or lower than the previous one.

## Understanding the 123 Strategy

The 123 chart pattern is a three-wave formation, where every move reaches a pivot point. These are referred to as the 1-2-3 pivot points, hence the name of the pattern. The first swing (number “1”) represents a move in the opposite direction of the current trend, followed by a correction (swing number “2”). The third and final swing (number “3”) confirms that a new trend has begun once it breaks the support/resistance (S/R) zone, which can be either bullish or bearish depending on whether the last swing was up or down.

The structure of the 123 chart formation includes three waves associated with the 1-2-3 pattern and one confirmation move. They form three pivot points and a confirmation level:

1. **Pivot Point 1:** This is the turning point during a trend. The beginning of every trend correction is a potential Pivot Point 1. If the 123 chart pattern is valid, then the price is very likely to break its previous trend line after creating Pivot Point 1.
2. **Pivot Point 2:** The next turning point is very likely to form outside of the previous trendline or channel. This is a good indication that the trend might be ready to end and reverse.
3. **Pivot Point 3:** Pivot Point 3 is crucial for the confirmation of the 123 reversal chart pattern. In a valid 123 reversal pattern, that point would not exceed Pivot Point 1. Pivot Point 3 moving close to Pivot Point 1, but not reaching it is an indication of a stronger 123 reversal pattern setup.
4. **Confirmation Level:** The confirmation level is the area, which tells us “Hey! This might be a good opportunity to enter the market based on a valid 123 reversal!” Its location is at the same level as Pivot Point 2. If the price breaks this level, then the pattern is said to be confirmed.

## Trading the 123 Strategy

The 123 reversal chart pattern combines well with a technical oscillator. The idea is to match a reversal signal from the 123 reversal setup with a reversal signal from an oscillator indicator. For example, the Relative Strength Index (RSI Indicator) can be used. If we have a bullish trend and the chart is forming a potential 123 reversal pattern, we will be looking for an overbought signal from the RSI. This way we will attain a stronger reversal signal, which is likely to bring a higher success rate for our pattern.

Contrary to this, if the trend is bearish and we spot a 123 reversal pattern, then we will try to match this signal with an oversold indication from the RSI. Another signal from the RSI that we can take is the regular divergence signal. Matching 123 signals with RSI divergences will give us a higher probability trade on the 123 reversal pattern.

## Risk Management

Always use a stop loss order when trading the 123 chart pattern or any other pattern. Your stop loss order should be placed in the area of Pivot Point 3. Sometimes, volatile market conditions can push the price to go beyond Pivot Point 3 for a short period. Then, the price will return and reverse again. You don’t want to get your stop activated due to this volatility. That’s why the smarter approach here is to put your stop slightly beyond that level.

## Conclusion

The 123 strategy is a powerful tool for identifying potential trend reversals. It's a simple yet effective strategy that combines the use of pivot points and technical oscillators like the RSI. However, like any trading strategy, it requires discipline, risk management, and a good understanding of market conditions to be successful.
