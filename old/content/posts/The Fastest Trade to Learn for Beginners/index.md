# Fast Track Learning: The Easiest Trade to Master

Trading in the financial markets can be a complex endeavor, requiring a deep understanding of financial instruments, market dynamics, and trading strategies. However, some trading techniques are easier to grasp and can provide a solid foundation for novice traders. One such technique is the 'Scalping Strategy'.

## Scalping Strategy

The philosophy behind a scalping strategy is that small wins can add up to a lot of money at the end of the day. The scalper sets buy and sell targets and sticks to these predetermined levels. The scalping strategy is fast, with several trades often made within a few seconds.

Scalping is one of the best day-trading strategies for confident traders who can make quick decisions and act on them without hesitation. Adherents to the scalping strategy have enough discipline to sell immediately if they witness a price decline, thus minimizing losses. If you are easily distracted and lack razor-sharp focus, this isn’t a day-trading strategy for you.

## Other Simple Trading Strategies

While scalping is one of the easiest strategies to master, there are other simple trading strategies that beginners might find useful:

1. **Momentum Trading**: With a momentum strategy, an investor jumps on a stock whose price is moving up. Momentum stocks are rare and hard to find. Look for these qualities in stocks if you’re using a momentum trading strategy: A major move in price, driven by a catalyst, stock movement of 30% or more, and smaller stocks, which trade faster due to the reduced number of outstanding shares.

2. **Pullback Trading Strategy**: The first step in the pullback strategy is to look for a stock or ETF with an established trend. Next, monitor the trend until there’s a price decline from the trend. If the established trend is upward, then the downward price movement — or pullback — is an entry point for the day trader to buy.

3. **Breakout Trading**: A breakout trade takes place when the stock price rises above the former top resistance price. Breakout trades on high volume are more likely to be sustainable at the new higher price than those breakouts with less volume.

4. **News Trading**: By keeping an eye on the business news, day traders can capitalize on popular daily stories. If bad news is out, you might short a stock during the day by “borrowing” shares of the stock from the investment firm and then selling those borrowed shares. If the stock price declines as expected, then you buy the shares back at the lower price and profit from the difference less a commission payment.

Remember, no matter what strategy you choose, it's important to start small, use stop losses to protect from oversize losses, and don't expect outsized gains. Day traders generally succeed by taking numerous small gains that outweigh their losses.
