# How Many People Achieve Success in Day Trading?

Day trading, the act of buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day, has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. However, the success rate among day traders is a topic of much debate and research. Let's delve into the statistics and studies to understand how many people do well at day trading.

## What Percentage of Day Traders Make Money?

The success rate of day traders is an elusive figure, but several studies and reports have attempted to quantify it. A study examining the profitability of 324 US-based day traders established that 64% lost money and only 36% realized profits in the duration of the study[^1^]. Another paper published in the Journal of Finance in April 2000 revealed that active day traders in the United States underperformed a value-weighted index by 10.3% annually[^2^].

In other countries, the success rate of day traders is similarly low. A study examining Taiwanese day traders found that only about 19% of all day traders made positive returns in 2011[^3^]. Three years later, a concept paper by the same researchers posited that on any given day, 97% of day traders lose money net of trading fees[^4^]. A study published in 2020 covering the Brazilian equity futures market established that only 1.1% of the surveyed day traders earned more than the countryâ€™s minimum wage net of fees[^5^].

## Demographics of Day Traders

Day trading is a predominantly male activity, with 90% of all day traders being male[^7^]. The average age of a day trader in the US is 31 years according to Robinhood, but other sources suggest an average age of at least 40 years[^9^]. In terms of race, 66.3% of day traders in the US are white, 11.5% Hispanic or Latino, 12.4% Asian, and 5.5% Black or African American[^8^].

## Preferred Day Trading Instruments

Day traders have a preference for certain trading instruments. Bitcoin is the most preferred trading instrument, followed by Gold and the EUR/USD currency pair[^11^]. However, based on daily trading volumes, stocks are the most traded by day traders and other categories of traders, with a $239.8 billion average daily trading volume in 2021[^12^].

In conclusion, while day trading can be profitable, it's also very risky, and a significant percentage of day traders lose money. The success rate among day traders is relatively low, with only a small percentage consistently making profits. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals considering day trading to understand the risks involved and to be well-prepared before diving in.
