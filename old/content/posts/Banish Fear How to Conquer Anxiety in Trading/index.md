# Banish Fear: How to Conquer Anxiety in Trading

Fear is a common emotion experienced by traders, often leading to suboptimal decisions and hindering their ability to make profitable trades. Understanding the root of this fear and learning how to manage it can significantly improve trading performance.

## Understanding Fear in Trading

Fear in trading can take many forms, including the fear of losing, fear of missing out (FOMO), or fear of being wrong. A good trader balances all these risks and acts rationally under all circumstances. They tolerate stress and filter out external pressures, usually by having a solid trading plan[^1^].

The fear of trading often arises from the unknown. When you don't know how much you can lose, you are essentially gambling, subjecting yourself to the unpredictable forces of the market[^1^]. This fear can also stem from a desire to always be right, a trait ingrained in us through our educational system. However, in trading, being right doesn't always equate to profitability[^4^].

## Overcoming Fear of Loss

Fear of loss in trading can be overcome by trading small, trading mechanically, and being ignorant to the market[^1^]. Trading small helps to remove emotions from trading. If you trade bigger than your comfort zone, you are less likely to follow your strategies and plans, leading to behavioral mistakes[^1^].

Trading mechanically, especially if you have done proper backtesting and out-of-sample testing, can help keep emotions at bay. Your only task is to start and stop your systems with your trading software[^1^].

Another method to keep emotions at bay is to develop checklists and make sure you have a rational framework for decision making[^1^]. Donâ€™t focus on the outcome but on how you make decisions. A good decision can lead to a bad result, but the opposite can also happen. As long as you focus on the process and not the result, you have come a long way[^1^].

## Addressing the Fear of Being Wrong

The fear of being wrong is a basic fear that traders often face towards their analysis. This usually manifests itself in fear of taking action. Traders might exit the trade prematurely, not trusting their technical analysis[^2^]. To overcome this fear, it's important to find confidence in your trading strategy[^2^].

## Managing Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

The fear of missing out on an opportunity can lead to hasty and poorly thought-out decisions. A trader might take an opportunity prematurely or post-maturely[^2^]. To avoid FOMO, it's crucial to stick to your trading plan and not chase the market[^4^].

## Dealing with Fear of Leaving Money on the Table

The fear of seeing profitable trades retrace and having the entire profit eaten up can lead to taking short and low profits on a trade[^2^]. The best way to deal with this fear is to have a solid exit strategy and stick to it[^2^].

## Final Thoughts

Fear in trading is normal and can be managed with the right mindset and strategies. By understanding the types of fear you may encounter and how to address them, you can make more rational decisions and improve your trading performance.

Remember, successful trading is a marathon, not a sprint. It's about long-term gains, not short-term wins. Embrace your fears, learn from them, and let them propel you forward in your trading journey[^2^][^4^].
