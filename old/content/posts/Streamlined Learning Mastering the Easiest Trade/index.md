# Streamlined Learning: Mastering the Easiest Trade

The art of trading can appear complex and intimidating to beginners. However, with a clear understanding of simple, efficient strategies, it is possible to start one's trading journey on the right foot. Various sources provide a multitude of strategies. By examining them, one can discover the easiest trade to master.

## Following The Trend

According to an article on Investopedia, one of the simplest strategies to master is "Following the Trend." This strategy, often used in day trading, is probably the most basic form of technical analysis, relying heavily on the prevailing market trend [^1^]. The basic premise is to buy when the market is rising and sell when it is falling. 

## Price Action Trading

Another simple trading strategy discussed on Priceaction.com is price action trading [^2^]. This approach involves analyzing raw price data over time, without the need for complex technical indicators. Traders look for specific patterns in the data that tend to repeat themselves, thus predicting future price movements.

## Basic Forex Trading Strategies

A beginner in forex trading may feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of strategies available. However, some simple and effective strategies can be mastered relatively easily, according to tradersunion.com [^3^].

One of these is the "Moving Average Crossover" strategy, where traders use two moving averages, one with a shorter period and one with a longer period. A buy signal is given when the shorter period MA crosses above the longer period MA, and a sell signal is provided when the shorter period MA crosses below the longer period MA.

The 'Support and Resistance' strategy is another simple, yet effective forex trading strategy suitable for beginners. It involves identifying levels on a price chart where the prices have previously found support (and bounced back) or resistance (and bounced down).

## Understanding Simple Forex Trading Strategies

Skrill News explains that for a beginner trader, simplicity is key [^4^]. Strategies like 'Trading the News,' where one trades based on high-impact news events, or 'Breakout Trading,' which capitalizes on price movements after periods of consolidation, are straightforward to understand and apply.

Admiral Markets also emphasizes the importance of straightforward strategies for novice forex traders [^5^]. An example given is the 'Forex 1-Hour Trading Strategy,' which involves taking advantage of the 20-period moving average of the one-hour chart. 

# Conclusion

In essence, the easiest trade to master isn't a single, universally agreed-upon concept. It's dependent on the individual trader's understanding, comfort with risk, and proficiency with technical analysis. That being said, some strategies are undoubtedly simpler and more straightforward, such as Following the Trend, Price Action Trading, Moving Average Crossover, and Support and Resistance strategies. By understanding these, beginner traders can embark on their trading journey with a firm foundation.
