# Banish Fear from Trading: Techniques to Boost Confidence

Fear is a common emotion experienced by traders, often leading to anxiety and hesitation in making trading decisions. This fear can stem from various factors such as the fear of losing money, the fear of making wrong decisions, or the fear of missing out on potential profits. However, it's important to understand that fear, while a natural response to perceived threats, can be detrimental to your trading performance if not properly managed.

## Understanding Fear in Trading

Fear in trading can take many forms. It could be the fear of losing, the fear of missing out (FOMO), or the fear of being wrong. A good trader is able to balance all these risks and act rationally under all circumstances. They can tolerate stress and filter out external pressures, most likely because they have a good trading plan. However, when fear begins to interfere with your trading, it's crucial to address the problem.

## Techniques to Overcome Fear

### 1. Prepare for Winning Performance

The first step to overcoming fear in trading is to prepare for a winning performance. This involves changing your negative expectations to winning expectations by preparing and telling yourself that you can trade successfully. Visualization techniques can be particularly helpful here. Imagine the trading day ahead of time, visualize yourself following your trading plan with discipline, and visualize yourself winning. This can help you feel fearless when it's time to trade.

### 2. Controlled Breathing

Controlled breathing is a simple yet effective technique to help you relax and reduce fear. Quick breathing is a trigger that starts all anxiety and fears into action. By controlling your breathing, you can become and stay fearless when trading. When you feel fear of trading, focus on your breath, take a deep breath in, pause for a second, then slowly breathe out. Repeat this process for a minute or two to help calm your nerves.

### 3. Release Control of Outcome

Trading is a game of probabilities where we can’t control or guarantee a positive outcome of every trade. Naturally, where we don’t have control, we experience fear. However, if you give up the illusion of control, you can overcome and control fear. This involves understanding that you can't control every aspect of trading and focusing instead on the things you can control, like your trading strategy and risk management.

### 4. Gratitude

Whenever you feel fear of trading, stop for a minute and think of what you are grateful for instead. If you are afraid of losing money, be grateful for the opportunity to make money from trading and the freedom the trader's lifestyle can give you. This shift in perspective can help reduce fear and anxiety.

### 5. Activate "The Thinking Brain"

Activating your "thinking brain" involves focusing on the process of trading rather than the outcome. A good decision can lead to a bad result, and a bad decision can lead to a good result. As long as you focus on the process and not the result, you have come a long way in overcoming fear.

## Trade Small and Mechanically

Trading small is a quick fix to remove emotions from trading. If you trade bigger than your comfort zone, you are less likely to follow your strategies and plans, leading to behavioral mistakes. Similarly, employing mechanical trading strategies can help keep emotions at bay. If you have done proper backtesting and out-of-sample testing, your only task is to start and stop your systems with your trading software.

## Conclusion

Overcoming fear in trading requires a combination of mental preparation, controlled breathing, releasing control of outcomes, practicing gratitude, activating the thinking brain, and trading small and mechanically. By implementing these techniques, you can boost your confidence and improve your trading performance. Remember, the key to successful trading is not just about making profitable trades, but also about managing your emotions and overcoming fear.
