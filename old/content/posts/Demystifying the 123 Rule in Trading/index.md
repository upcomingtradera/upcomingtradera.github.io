# Demystifying the 123 Rule in Trading

The 123 rule in trading is a popular pattern used by traders to identify potential reversals in the market. It's a simple yet effective strategy that can be used in any market, including stocks, forex, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. This guide will explain what the 123 rule is and how to use it in your trading.

## Understanding the 123 Rule

The 123 rule, also known as the 123 reversal chart pattern, is a three-swing price formation that indicates a potential reversal in trend. It is formed by three price swings or waves with three swing points, which is where the name of the pattern comes from. The 123 pattern reversal starts with the price swing not making the expected higher high (in an uptrend) or lower low (in a downtrend) and then breaking below or above a support or resistance level as the case may be. This change in price structure can help predict a potential reversal.

There are two versions of the 123 reversal pattern: a potential bearish reversal from an uptrend and a potential bullish reversal from a downtrend. In both cases, the market initially follows the existing trend, making a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows in an uptrend, or lower swing lows and lower swing highs in a downtrend. However, at some point, the current price swing doesn't manage to rise above the previous high or fall below the previous low, indicating that the trend might be in danger.

## Trading the 123 Pattern

### Trade Entry

The 123 pattern is confirmed when the price breaks above or below (as the case may be) point 2. A trade is entered at the close of the breakout price bar or the beginning of the next bar after it. If the breakout bar is very tall, you may want to wait for a retest of the breakout level.

### Stop Loss

As with any other strategy, you might use a stop loss order when trading the 123 chart pattern. Place your stop loss order below (in the case of a bullish setup) or above (in the case of a bearish setup) point 3. It may also be wiser to place the stop loss beyond point 1, especially if the market is highly volatile.

### Profit Target

You can estimate your price target by measuring the pattern itself. You measure the distance between point 2 and the midpoint of a line connecting point 1 and point 3, then project this distance from the breakout point to get the estimated profit target.

## Conclusion

The 123 pattern reversal strategy is a popular and effective trading strategy. It's simple to understand and can be used in any market. However, like any trading strategy, it's important to practice and backtest the strategy before using it in live trading. Remember, successful trading is not just about finding the right strategy, but also about managing your risks and continuously learning and improving.
