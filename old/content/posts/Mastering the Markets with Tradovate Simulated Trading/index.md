# Mastering the Markets with Tradovate Simulated Trading

Simulated trading is a powerful tool that allows traders to practice their trading strategies in a risk-free environment. Tradovate, a renowned platform for futures trading, offers a comprehensive simulated trading environment for its users. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using Tradovate's simulated trading feature.

## What is Tradovate Simulated Trading?

Tradovate Simulated Trading is a feature that allows traders to practice futures trading in a risk-free environment. It uses real-time market data to show what is actually occurring in the market, enabling traders to place trades without sending those orders to the live market at the exchange. In other words, you are trading without using real money.

## Benefits of Tradovate Simulated Trading

Simulated trading offers numerous benefits to traders of all experience levels. Here are some key advantages:

### Practice

Many endeavors in life require practice and repetition to make advancements in performance, and futures trading is no different. Learning things like entry timing, stop placement, and position sizing through practice is an important part of the trading journey.

### Risk-free

Simulated trading removes the risk to actual capital from the learning equation. It allows traders to focus on training, skill development, and preparing to handle many types of scenarios and situations without the distraction of what could happen if they were actually trading with real money.

### Stress-free

After a few trades that didnâ€™t go their way, some traders like to go to the sideline while they clear their head and reassess what is happening as part of their risk management plan. Instead of totally unplugging from the market, they want to keep their finger directly on the pulse of the action without assuming risk, so they switch to simulated trading as a way to stay in the game while they figure out what to do next, without the emotional effect that live trading can produce.

## How to Get Started with Tradovate Simulated Trading

To get started with Tradovate Simulated Trading, you need to sign up for a Tradovate account. Once you have an account, you can access the simulation feature directly within the live trading platform simply by switching account numbers. This makes the transition from simulated to live trading as seamless as switching account numbers.

## Costs and Fees

The Tradovate Simulation account is available for a fee of $12.95 per month. However, it's important to note that Tradovate does not charge platform fees. Exchange, NFA, and clearing fees still apply. 

After the initial 2 weeks of free data, you will need to pay for continued access to market data. The cost of this data depends on the level of detail you want to see. For example, top of book data, which shows the current price and best bid and ask, costs $3 per month. For more detailed data, such as Depth of Market (DOM) data, which shows the best 5-10 bid/ask prices, the cost is higher.

## Conclusion

While simulated trading can't fully replicate the emotional impact of trading with real money, it's an excellent training tool that futures traders of all experience levels can utilize to hone their trading skills. Tradovate includes unlimited real-time simulated trading in their Active and Advanced membership levels, and users can access simulation directly within the live trading platform simply by switching account numbers. This feature makes the transition from simulated to live trading as seamless as switching account numbers.
