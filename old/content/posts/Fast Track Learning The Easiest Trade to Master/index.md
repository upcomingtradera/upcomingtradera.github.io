Based on the information gathered from the five articles, the easiest trading technique to master, especially for beginners, appears to be the "Trend Following" or "Trend Trading" strategy. This strategy is mentioned in multiple articles and is often recommended for beginners due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Fast Track Learning: The Easiest Trade to Master

### Trend Following or Trend Trading

Trend following is a strategy used in all trading markets, including forex and commodities. It involves identifying an upward or downward trend in a currency price movement and then choosing trade entry and exit points based on the positioning of the currency's price within the trend and the trend's relative strength.

#### How it Works

1. **Identify the Trend**: The first step in trend following is to identify whether the market is trending upwards, downwards, or sideways. This can be done by looking at charts and using various indicators such as moving averages, relative strength indicators, volume measurements, directional indices, and stochastics.

2. **Entry Point**: Once a trend has been identified, the next step is to determine a good entry point. This is usually done by looking for a pullback within the trend. For example, if the overall trend is upwards, then the trader would look for a temporary drop in the price to enter a long position (buy).

3. **Exit Point**: Similarly, the exit point is usually determined by identifying a reversal in the trend. This could be when the price starts moving against the trend by a certain amount or percentage.

#### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Trend following is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners.
- **Effectiveness**: It is one of the most commonly used strategies and has been proven to be effective over time.
- **Applicable to All Time Frames**: This strategy can be applied to various time frames, whether you're a day trader or a long-term investor.

#### Disadvantages

- **Dependent on Trend**: The main disadvantage of this strategy is that it relies on the existence of a trend. In a sideways or ranging market, trend following strategies may not be effective.
- **Late Entry**: Since trend following strategies require confirmation of a trend, they may result in late entries, causing traders to miss part of the initial move.

Remember, no strategy guarantees success in trading. It's important to practice risk management and continuously review and adjust your strategy based on market conditions and performance.
