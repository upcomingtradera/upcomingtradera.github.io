# World's Biggest Day Trader: A Closer Look

The world of trading has seen many successful individuals, but when it comes to the biggest day trader, Dr. David Paul stands out. He is one of the most famous day traders in the world, with a deep understanding of trading techniques and global markets. 

## Dr. David Paul: A Brief Background

Born to a middle-class family in Northern Ireland, Dr. David Paul completed a BSC degree in mechanical engineering and migrated to South Africa in the early 80s. There, he worked for the Anglo Group company conducting engineering research. After a decade of residing in South Africa, he quit his job at the company and founded his own engineering company that manufactured mining tools for the South African market. 

In 1992, Paul sold his company and joined the board of directors of the Rivonia branch. From then on, he started teaching stock and Forex traders about effective trading. As a financial trader, he held thousands of seminars in the UK, Europe, and South Africa, which were well received. His primary strategy in the stock market is to look for companies that match a certain criteria â€” namely that they're undervalued, increasing revenue aggressively, while the market is in an upswing.

## Other Notable Traders

While Dr. David Paul is a prominent figure in day trading, there are other traders who have also made significant contributions to the field. These include:

- **Richard Dennis**: Known as the "Prince of The Pit", he turned a $1,600 loan into $350 million in the 1970s.

- **Paul Tudor Jones**: A well-known American hedge fund manager and one of the best futures traders of all time. He is the CEO of the Tudor Investment Corporation, which manages over $8 million in client assets.

- **Thomas Bulkowski**: A leading trader in the United States known for discovering and teaching new patterns to a wide audience. He authored some of the most iconic stock-trading books including "Encyclopedia of Candlestick Charts" and "Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns".

- **Michael Burry**: An American hedge-fund manager featured in the movie "The Big Short" for his experience of shorting the sub-prime market before the economic crash of 2008.

These traders, along with Dr. David Paul, have demonstrated exceptional skills and strategies in the trading world, making them some of the most successful and influential figures in the industry.
