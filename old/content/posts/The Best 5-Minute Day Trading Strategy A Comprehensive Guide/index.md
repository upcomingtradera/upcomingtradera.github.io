# The Best 5-Minute Day Trading Strategy: A Comprehensive Guide

Day trading strategies are essential when you are looking to capitalize on frequent, small price movements. A consistent, effective strategy relies on in-depth technical analysis, utilizing charts, indicators, and patterns to predict future price movements. This article will provide you with an understanding of popular 5-minute strategies, outlining their pros, cons, and other essential details.

## 5-Minute Momo Trade

The 5-Minute Momo strategy from Investopedia is designed to help traders capitalize on the momentum of the forex market. The strategy uses two indicators: a 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) and the MACD histogram. The idea is to enter trades on price pullbacks to the EMA and exit when the momentum fades.

### How it Works

1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below the 20 EMA and MACD to get into negative territory.
2. Wait for the price to move up beyond the 20 EMA and then ensure that the MACD is either about to move from negative to positive or is already in the positive territory within the last five bars on the 5-minute chart.
3. Take a long position 10 pips above the 20 EMA.
4. For an aggressive trade, position a stop at the swing low on the 5-minute chart. However, for a conservative trade, the stop should be positioned 20 pips below the 20 EMA.
5. Half of the position should be sold at entry along with the risked amount; then move the stop on the second half to breakeven.
6. Trail the stop by breakeven or the 20 EMA minus 15 pips, whichever is higher.

The strategy also has rules for a short trading position, which are essentially the inverse of the rules for a long trading position.

## EMA and MACD Strategy

The EMA and MACD strategy from BrokerXplorer is another popular 5-minute trading strategy. It uses the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to determine the trend and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to measure momentum.

### How it Works

1. Identify a currency pair that is trading below the 20 EMA and MACD to get into negative territory.
2. Wait for the price to move up beyond the 20 EMA and then ensure that the MACD is either about to move from negative to positive or is already in the positive territory within the last five bars on the 5-minute chart.
3. Take a long position 10 pips above the 20 EMA.
4. For an aggressive trade, position a stop at the swing low on the 5-minute chart. However, for a conservative trade, the stop should be positioned 20 pips below the 20 EMA.
5. Half of the position should be sold at entry along with the risked amount; then move the stop on the second half to breakeven.
6. Trail the stop by breakeven or the 20 EMA minus 15 pips, whichever is higher.

The strategy also has rules for a short trading position, which are essentially the inverse of the rules for a long trading position.

## 5-Minute Scalping Strategy

The 5-Minute Scalping Strategy from FBS is a simple and effective strategy for short-term traders. It uses the 8-period and 21-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the H1 and M5 timeframes.

### How it Works

1. On the H1 chart, confirm that the 8-period EMA is above the 21-period EMA, indicating an uptrend.
2. Switch to the M5 chart and wait for a candlestick to touch the 8-period EMA by its bottom.
3. Find the highest candlestick among the five that appeared before the trigger bar.
4. Open a buy position at the high of this candlestick, with a stop loss at the low of the trigger bar.
5. Set the first take profit at the same distance as the one between entry and stop loss. If the trend remains strong on H1, set a second take profit at a distance twice as big as the one between entry and stop loss.

The strategy also has rules for a short trading position, which are essentially the inverse of the rules for a long trading position.

## Conclusion

These three strategies provide a starting point for your 5-minute day trading journey. Remember, successful trading is not about the number of trades you make, but rather the quality of the trades. Always use a demo account to test your strategies before applying them to a live trading environment.
