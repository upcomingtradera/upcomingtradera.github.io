# Who Stands at the Top? The Most Profitable Day Trader Ever

The world of day trading has seen many successful traders, but few have achieved the level of fame and fortune as Steve Cohen. Known for his colossal gains and losses, Cohen is arguably the most profitable hedge fund trader ever. His firm, SAC Capital, returned 30% annually for more than 20 years since its inception in 1992, making Cohen a billionaire. What many people don’t know is that Cohen started his career as a day trader.

## Steve Cohen: The Billionaire Day Trader

Cohen started his trading career after graduating from Wharton college and began working as a junior options trader for a small investment bank Gruntal & Co. By 1984, he was managing a trading group at the company. Cohen’s trading generated $100,000 a day for the firm and made him wealthy fast. Early in his career, he was making $10 million a year with positions in takeovers and IPOs.

In the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, Cohen’s group lost half of their trading capital and the trading firm Gruntal & Co. was put out of business. Almost all the firm’s traders were ruined. After the shutting down of Gruntal & Co. Cohen went out to start his own firm.

He launched his hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors in 1992 with $23 million and $10 million of that Cohen’s own capital and nine employees. SAC used an aggressive, high-volume trading approach with stock positions being held for 2-30 days and sometimes hours. Cohen continued with a lot of day trading in his early money management career. In three years, SAC quadrupled in size to $100 million under management.

## The Rise and Fall of SAC Capital

Cohen’s SAC success used high-risk, high-reward trades. He traded the late 1990s dot-com bubble for 70% returns and earned another 70% shorting those same dot-com stocks during the dot-com bubble popping in 2000.

However, the end of SAC capital came when eight SAC employees were found guilty of insider trading from 1999 through 2010, along with portfolio manager Michael Steinberg. SAC Capital was charged directly for insider trading and pled guilty. SAC received a $900 million criminal penalty and $1.8 billion in financial penalties. The plea deal and settlement included terms that barred Cohen from managing any investor assets for two years.

## Steve Cohen Today

Despite the controversies, Cohen remains a prominent figure in the trading world. He converted his investment operations from SAC Capital to Point72 Asset Management in 2014. By January 2018, the firm was granted regulatory clearance to raise outside capital and allowed to resume money management operations. Point72 Asset Management is a $26 billion hedge fund firm.

Cohen also bought the New York Mets in 2020 for $2.4 billion as the majority owner. This is the highest sale price ever paid for a major league baseball team. He is also the richest owner in the major league.

As of 2022, Steve Cohen’s current net worth is $17.5 billion dollars making him the 83rd wealthiest person in the world. This level of wealth is a testament to his skills as a day trader and his ability to navigate the tumultuous world of trading.

## Other Notable Day Traders

While Steve Cohen stands out for his success in day trading, other traders have also made their mark. For instance, Jesse Lauriston Livermore, an American trader famous for both colossal gains and losses in the market, successfully shorted the 1929 market crash, building his fortune to $100 million. However, by 1934 he had lost his money and tragically took his own life in 1940.

George Soros, the chair of Soros Fund Management, is another renowned trader. He earned the moniker “The Man Who Broke the Bank of England” in 1992 after his short sale of $10 billion worth of pounds, yielding a tidy $1 billion profit.

Despite the risks and challenges, these traders have demonstrated that with skill, determination, and a keen understanding of the markets, day trading can indeed be a profitable venture.
