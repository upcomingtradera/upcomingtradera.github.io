# Unveiling the Failure Rate Among Traders

The failure rate among traders is a topic of interest for many, especially those considering entering the trading world. Various studies and data have been conducted and collected to shed light on this subject. Here's what we found:

## Quantified Strategies Research

According to research by Quantified Strategies, about 80% to 90% of all day traders lose money. This figure is based on their analysis of day trading data. They also note that this is a rough estimate and the actual figure could be higher or lower depending on various factors[^1^].

## Traders Union Analysis

Traders Union, in their analysis of proprietary trading, suggests that the failure rate of prop traders is around 90%. They attribute this high failure rate to the high-risk nature of prop trading and the lack of proper risk management strategies among many prop traders[^2^].

## Investopedia's Insight

Investopedia, a leading financial education website, states that more than 80% of traders eventually fail and quit. They attribute this high failure rate to the difficulty of booking reliable profits in financial markets. They also suggest that the actual washout rate could be much higher than 80%[^3^].

## Tradeciety's Statistics

Tradeciety provides some startling statistics about trader failure rates. They state that 80% of all day traders quit within the first two years. Furthermore, only 13% continue to day trade after three years, and after five years, only 7% remain. They also note that profitable day traders make up a small proportion of all traders â€“ 1.6% in the average year[^4^].

In conclusion, while the exact failure rate among traders can vary depending on the source and the specific group of traders being analyzed, it's clear that a significant majority of traders fail to achieve sustained profitability. This underscores the importance of proper education, risk management, and realistic expectations when entering the trading world.
