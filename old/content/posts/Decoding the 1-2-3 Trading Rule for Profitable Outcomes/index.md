# Decoding the 1-2-3 Trading Rule for Profitable Outcomes

The 1-2-3 trading rule, also known as the 1-2-3 reversal pattern, is a common strategy used by traders to identify potential reversals in market trends. This pattern is based on three pivot points that form during a price trend.

## Understanding the 1-2-3 Trading Rule

The 1-2-3 trading rule is a reversal pattern used in technical analysis to predict the reversal of trends in different markets, including Forex, stocks, and futures. This pattern is characterized by three distinct points on a chart that signal a potential reversal in the market trend.

1. **Pivot Point 1**: This is the turning point during a trend. The beginning of every trend correction is a potential Pivot Point 1. If the 1-2-3 chart pattern is valid, then the price is very likely to break its previous trend line after creating Pivot Point 1.

2. **Pivot Point 2**: The next turning point is very likely to form outside of the previous trendline or channel. This is a good indication that the trend might be ready to end and reverse.

3. **Pivot Point 3**: Pivot Point 3 is crucial for the confirmation of the 1-2-3 reversal chart pattern. The reason for this is that it is the last component of the setup. In a valid 1-2-3 reversal pattern, that point would not exceed Pivot Point 1. Worst-case scenario, it would be at the same level. Pivot Point 3 moving close to Pivot Point 1, but not reaching it is an indication of a stronger 1-2-3 reversal pattern setup.

The confirmation level is the area, which tells us “Hey! This might be a good opportunity to enter the market based on a valid 1-2-3 reversal!” Its location is at the same level as Pivot Point 2. If the price breaks this level, then the pattern is said to be confirmed.

## Implementing the 1-2-3 Trading Rule

To implement the 1-2-3 trading rule, traders typically enter a short position as the market breaks below the level of Pivot Point 2. The stop-loss order is placed in the area of Pivot Point 3. Sometimes, volatile market conditions can push the price to go beyond Pivot Point 3 for a short period. Then, the price will return and reverse again. You don’t want to get your stop activated due to this volatility. That’s why the smarter approach here is to put your stop slightly beyond that level.

The target level during a 1-2-3 trade should be at a distance equal to the size of the 1-2-3 chart pattern. Applying it from the start of the confirmation level will give you your approximate target level.

## Enhancing the 1-2-3 Trading Rule with Oscillators

The 1-2-3 reversal chart pattern combines well with a technical oscillator. The reason for this is that oscillators can help signal extreme values, which can provide confirmation of trend reversals. For example, the Relative Strength Index (RSI Indicator) can be used to match a reversal signal from the 1-2-3 reversal setup with a reversal signal from the RSI indicator.

## The 1-2-3 Trading Rule as a Continuation Pattern

Although the 1-2-3 chart setup is primarily used as a reversal pattern, it could also act as a continuation pattern. In other words, it could give us a signal that the trend is not reversing. Instead, we might be looking at a flatter correction, which could trigger a new move in the same direction.

In conclusion, the 1-2-3 trading rule is a powerful tool for predicting market reversals. However, like all trading strategies, it requires careful application and should be used in conjunction with other indicators and strategies to maximize its effectiveness.
