A book: https://www.amazon.com/How-Trade-Stocks-Livermore-Combining/dp/0934380201

"How to Trade in Stocks: The Livermore Formula for Combining Time Element and Price" is a book written by Jesse Livermore, first published in 1940. It is the only book written by Livermore himself, and it provides a detailed account of his trading experiences and the methods he used to achieve his success in the stock market.

Jesse Livermore's trading success can be attributed to several key principles, among which are discipline, patience, and what he called the "time element." These concepts played a crucial role in his trading approach and can offer valuable insights for today's traders.

The book outlines Livermore's unique approach to trading, focusing on the time element and price as key factors in making profitable trades. Livermore believed that by combining these two elements, traders could develop a system that allowed them to consistently identify high-probability trading opportunities.

In the book, Livermore discusses his trading philosophy and presents a set of rules and guidelines that he followed throughout his career. Some of these rules include:

- [x] **Discipline**
  - Livermore emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline in trading. This involves creating and sticking to a well-defined trading plan, managing risk effectively, and avoiding impulsive decisions driven by emotions such as fear or greed. By remaining disciplined, traders can consistently execute their strategies, protect their capital, and maximize their potential for success.

- [x] **Patience**
  - Patience is another critical aspect of Livermore's trading philosophy. He often said that the ability to wait for the right opportunity was one of the most important skills a trader could possess. Livermore understood that not every market condition was suitable for trading, and being patient allowed him to wait for high-probability setups that offered a greater chance of success. In practice, this meant avoiding overtrading and resisting the urge to chase the market or jump into trades without proper analysis.

- [x] **Time Element** 
  - The "time element" refers to Livermore's belief in the significance of timing in trading. He acknowledged that entering and exiting trades at the right time was crucial for success. This involved waiting for confirmations of trend changes, breakouts, or reversals before initiating trades. By understanding the time element, Livermore was able to better manage his trades, reduce the likelihood of getting caught in false signals, and improve his overall trading performance.

> Jesse Livermore's trading approach highlights the importance of discipline, patience, and the time element.

 - [x] **Trade with the trend**
   - Livermore emphasized the importance of following the overall market trend and avoiding trades that went against it.
 - [x] **Cut losses quickly**
   - He stressed the importance of limiting losses by using stop-loss orders and exiting losing positions promptly.
 - [x] **Be patient and wait for the right opportunities**
   - Livermore believed in waiting for high-probability trade setups and not rushing into trades.
 - [x] **Manage risk**
   - He advocated for proper risk management techniques, including position sizing and risk-reward analysis.
 - [x] **Learn from mistakes**
   - Livermore encouraged traders to analyze their past trades and learn from both their successes and failures.

> Although "How to Trade in Stocks" was written many decades ago, its lessons and principles are still relevant and valuable for modern traders.

The book also covers Livermore's use of pivotal points, which were key price levels that he believed could trigger significant market moves. He used these points to time his trades and capitalize on emerging trends. Although "How to Trade in Stocks" was written many decades ago, its lessons and principles are still relevant and valuable for modern traders. The book offers insights into the mindset and strategies of one of the most successful traders in history, making it an essential read for anyone interested in trading and investing.
