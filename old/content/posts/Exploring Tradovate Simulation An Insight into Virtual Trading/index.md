# Exploring Tradovate Simulation: An Insight into Virtual Trading

Simulated trading is a powerful tool for both novice and experienced traders. It allows individuals to practice their trading strategies in a risk-free environment, using real-time market data, without the need to invest real money. Tradovate, a renowned platform for futures trading, offers a comprehensive simulated trading environment for its users.

## What is Tradovate Simulation?

Tradovate Simulation is a feature that allows traders to practice futures trading in a risk-free environment. It uses real-time market data to show what is actually occurring in the market, enabling traders to place trades without sending those orders to the live market at the exchange. In other words, you are trading without using real money.

## Benefits of Simulated Trading

Simulated trading offers numerous benefits to traders of all experience levels. Here are some key advantages:

### Practice

Many endeavors in life require practice and repetition to make advancements in performance, and futures trading is no different. Learning things like entry timing, stop placement, and position sizing through practice is an important part of the trading journey.

### Risk-free

Simulated trading removes the risk to actual capital from the learning equation. It allows traders to focus on training, skill development, and preparing to handle many types of scenarios and situations without the distraction of what could happen if they were actually trading with real money.

### Stress-free

After a few trades that didn’t go their way, some traders like to go to the sideline while they clear their head and reassess what is happening as part of their risk management plan. Instead of totally unplugging from the market, they want to keep their finger directly on the pulse of the action without assuming risk, so they switch to simulated trading as a way to stay in the game while they figure out what to do next, without the emotional effect that live trading can produce.

## Simulated Trading for New and Experienced Traders

For new traders, simulated trading offers a platform to learn how to trade futures without putting any capital at risk. It allows them to practice trade execution, order placement, and risk management as the market is moving. It also enables them to learn how Tradovate’s platform works and how the various trading and analysis tools function.

Experienced traders also find value in simulated trading. Markets are dynamic and ever-changing, and traders sometimes need to change with the markets. Testing new ideas and techniques that culminate in the creation of a brand-new strategy or trading a new contract can be done in live trading. However, using simulated trading instead of trading live can save precious capital when the new strategy doesn’t work as expected, or the market action trades differently in a new contract.

## Conclusion

While simulated trading can't fully replicate the emotional impact of trading with real money, it's an excellent training tool that futures traders of all experience levels can utilize to hone their trading skills. Tradovate includes unlimited real-time simulated trading in their Active and Advanced membership levels, and users can access simulation directly within the live trading platform simply by switching account numbers. This feature makes the transition from simulated to live trading as seamless as switching account numbers.
