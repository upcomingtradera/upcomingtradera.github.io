# Maximizing Your Trading Skills with NinjaTrader's Free Simulator

## NinjaTrader's Free Trading Simulator

NinjaTrader provides a free trading simulator for futures trading. This simulator allows you to practice trading and test your trading ideas without risking any real money. The platform offers unlimited simulation included with all funded trading accounts, a free two-week trial with live-streaming market data, and the ability to test new trading ideas before putting money at risk. The simulator includes a free backtesting engine, the ability to replay historical market data tick by tick, and control over your own data feed. Once you open your account, you can sharpen your trading skills in NinjaTrader's free futures trading simulation.

## Free Trade Simulator

Free Trade Simulator also highlights the benefits of NinjaTrader’s free trade simulation. It includes paper trading of futures, Forex, and stocks, full order and account simulation, a realistic order fill algorithm, the option to use simulated, recorded, or live data, and feature-rich account performance to track your progress. Several order entry windows are provided to fit your trading style.

## Day Trade To Win

Day Trade To Win offers a real-time simulator for free. It allows you to practice trading with live futures markets like the E-mini S&P. The platform uses NinjaTrader, with advanced charting tools and Level II data. You can improve your abilities by placing simulated trades, then move on to the real thing.

## Affordable Indicators

Affordable Indicators explains that NinjaTrader provides an immersive simulated trading experience. You can trade for free in NinjaTrader’s simulation environment, which is designed to mimic live trading as closely as possible. For those new to the markets, paper trading futures and forex in real-time using live market data provides valuable practice. NinjaTrader also provides two additional data sources for paper trading: the Simulated Data Feed and the Playback Connection with Market Replay data.

## The Balance

The Balance also recommends NinjaTrader as a low-cost futures and forex trading platform with upgrade options. The free software lets users simulate live day-trading of futures and currencies at their leisure. There is also an option to download data from prior days so you can practice trading with the market activity from that period. If you want to use NinjaTrader to conduct actual transactions, the company provides that service through NinjaTrader Brokerage or another brokerage it has partnered with. Commissions are 35 cents per micro contract for users of the free platform. Paying customers can lease the platform and receive premium Trader + features such as automatic stop-loss and profit-target orders, one cancels the other (OCO) orders, and order entry hotkeys.
