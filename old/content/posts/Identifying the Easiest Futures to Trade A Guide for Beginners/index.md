# Identifying the Easiest Futures to Trade: A Guide for Beginners

Choosing the right futures to trade can be a daunting task, especially for beginners. The choice of futures to trade depends on various factors such as the trader's strategy, capital, risk tolerance, and the specific characteristics of the futures market. Here are some of the easiest futures to trade based on various sources:

## Eurodollar Futures

Eurodollar futures are among the most traded interest rates globally. They provide a valuable and cost-effective financial instrument for hedging fluctuations in the U.S. dollar interest rates. Eurodollars are simply U.S. dollars that are deposited in commercial banks outside the U.S. Some of their benefits include lower transaction costs, price transparency, unsurpassed liquidity, and diverse trading opportunities. Today, about 98% of Eurodollar futures are traded electronically on the CME Globex trading platform[^1^][^3^].

## E-mini S&P 500 Futures

E-mini S&P 500 futures, denoted by the ticker symbol ES, are a great option if you want to add or manage your exposure to large-cap companies in the U.S. stock market. They offer an efficient, liquid, and cost-effective way to gain market exposure to the S&P 500 Index, which tracks 500 of the U.S. economy’s largest companies[^3^].

## Crude Oil Futures

Crude oil futures are the most efficient way for you to trade the global oil markets. The NYMEX WTI — the most actively traded crude oil contract — trades close to 1.2 million contracts per day. To understand, 1 contract = 1,000 barrels and is valued at nearly $44,740. NYMEX WTI futures give you direct exposure to the global oil market[^3^].

## 10-Year Treasury Note Futures

U.S. Treasury futures are an efficient way to trade the U.S. government bond market, which offers the greatest security and diversity among government bond markets worldwide. These deeply liquid futures provide efficient tools for potentially enhancing income, hedging interest-rate risk, spread trading, speculating on interest rates, and adjusting portfolio duration[^3^].

## Micro E-mini S&P 500 Index Futures

Micro E-mini futures are 1/10th the size of an E-mini contract. They give you a simple, cost-effective way to trade in the equity index markets. These futures manage your exposure to the 500 U.S. large-cap stocks[^3^].

## E-Mini Contracts

E-Mini contracts such as E-Mini Russell 2000 (TY and RTY), E-Mini S&P 500 (ES), E-Mini Dow (YM), and E-Mini Nasdaq 100 (NQ) are also considered good options for day trading due to their lower margins and high liquidity[^4^].

## High Volume Contracts

High volume contracts such as Eurodollars (GE), 10-Year Treasury Notes (ZN), E-Mini S&P 500 (ES), and Crude Oil (CL) are also considered suitable for day trading due to their high intraday volatility[^4^].

Remember, the best futures to trade will depend on your individual trading strategy and risk tolerance. Always do your research and consider your personal trading requirements when selecting a market to trade.
