# Number Magic: Unpacking the 123 Rule in Trading

The 123 rule, also known as the 123 pattern or 123 reversal pattern, is a common technical analysis tool used by traders to identify potential trend reversals in financial markets. This pattern is formed by three consecutive price swings, each swing being higher or lower than the previous one, hence the name "123".

## Understanding the 123 Rule

The first swing, labeled as "1", represents a move in the opposite direction of the current trend. This is followed by a correction, the second swing, labeled as "2". The third and final swing, labeled as "3", confirms that a new trend has begun once it breaks the support/resistance (S/R) zone. This new trend can be either bullish or bearish depending on whether the last swing was up or down.

The 123 pattern is a three-wave formation, where every move reaches a pivot point. These pivot points are crucial in identifying and confirming the 123 pattern. If the pattern is correctly identified and confirmed, it can help predict potential reversals.

## Structure of the 123 Pattern

The 123 pattern consists of three pivot points and a confirmation level:

1. **Pivot Point 1:** This is the turning point during a trend. The beginning of every trend correction is a potential Pivot Point 1. If the 123 chart pattern is valid, then the price is very likely to break its previous trend line after creating Pivot Point 1.

2. **Pivot Point 2:** The next turning point is very likely to form outside of the previous trendline or channel. This is a good indication that the trend might be ready to end and reverse.

3. **Pivot Point 3:** Pivot Point 3 is crucial for the confirmation of the 123 reversal chart pattern. In a valid 123 reversal pattern, that point would not exceed Pivot Point 1. Pivot Point 3 moving close to Pivot Point 1, but not reaching it, is an indication of a stronger 123 reversal pattern setup.

4. **Confirmation Level:** The confirmation level is the area, which tells us that this might be a good opportunity to enter the market based on a valid 123 reversal. Its location is at the same level as Pivot Point 2. If the price breaks this level, then the pattern is said to be confirmed.

## Trading the 123 Pattern

The 123 pattern can be used as a reversal pattern or a continuation pattern. As a reversal pattern, it signals a potential change in the market direction. As a continuation pattern, it indicates that the trend is not reversing but instead, we might be looking at a flatter correction, which could trigger a new move in the same direction.

When trading the 123 pattern, traders often use trend indicators to identify possible support and resistance levels within the pattern. These indicators help them make informed decisions about entering and exiting trades based on this particular chart formation.

## Conclusion

The 123 rule in trading is a powerful tool for predicting potential trend reversals. By understanding its structure and how to identify it, traders can use this pattern to make informed decisions and potentially increase their chances of successful trades. However, like any trading strategy, it's important to use proper risk management and not rely solely on one indicator.
