Gather 'round, aspiring traders and Wall Street enthusiasts, for a thrilling journey into the world of Jesse Livermore, the enigmatic trading genius who left an indelible mark on the annals of financial history. From humble beginnings as a teenage runaway to becoming one of the wealthiest and most feared traders on Wall Street, Livermore's story is an epic tale of triumph, tragedy, and timeless wisdom.

Amidst the smoke-filled bucket shops and bustling stock exchange floors, Livermore developed a unique set of trading rules that propelled him to legendary status. Etched with the scars of his hard-won experience, these rules form a treasure trove of insights for any trader seeking to navigate the treacherous waters of the stock market.

1. Rule One
 - **Follow the Trend** – Like a skilled sailor navigating stormy seas, Livermore understood the power of the market's current. He stressed the importance of trading with the trend, riding the waves of price action to success rather than fighting against the tide.
  - [x] **Identifying the trend**: The first step in trend following is to identify the direction of the prevailing trend.
     - Moving Averages
        - A moving average smooths out price data, creating a line that traders can use to identify the trend's direction. Commonly used moving averages include the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). A rising moving average indicates an uptrend, while a falling moving average suggests a downtrend.
     - Trendlines
        - Trendlines are diagonal lines drawn on a price chart to connect a series of higher lows in an uptrend or lower highs in a downtrend. These lines help traders visualize the direction and strength of the trend.
     - Price Action Analysis
        - Traders can also analyze the price chart itself to identify the trend by looking for higher highs and higher lows (indicative of an uptrend) or lower highs and lower lows (signaling a downtrend).

   - [x] **Entry signals**: Once the trend is identified, trend followers look for entry signals to open a position in the direction of the trend.
     - Moving average crossovers
        - A common entry signal is when a shorter-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) crosses above a longer-term moving average (e.g., 200-day) in an uptrend or below it in a downtrend.
     - Breakouts: Traders may enter a position when the price breaks above a resistance level in an uptrend or below a support level in a downtrend, as this can indicate a continuation of the trend.
     - Pullbacks: Some traders wait for the price to retrace or "pull back" to a support level in an uptrend or a resistance level in a downtrend before entering a position, as this can offer a more favorable entry point.

   - [x] **Exit strategies**: A crucial aspect of trend following is knowing when to exit a trade. Trend followers aim to let profits run and cut losses short.
     - Moving average crossovers in the opposite direction of the trade
     - Price breaking through a trendline
     - A predetermined profit target or trailing stop being hit

2. Rule Two
 - **Cut Losses Quickly** – In the merciless jungle of the stock market, Livermore knew that survival depended on avoiding fatal wounds. By cutting losses swiftly when trades went awry, he ensured his trading capital lived to fight another day.
  - [x] Stop-loss orders: A stop-loss order is an order placed with your broker to sell a security when it reaches a specific price. This helps limit your loss on a trade by automatically closing the position if the market moves against you. Always use a stop-loss order when entering a trade to define your maximum risk.
     - Do not adjust your stop-loss orders once placed.
  - [x] Trailing stop orders: A trailing stop order is a type of stop-loss order that moves with the market price as it moves in your favor. This allows you to lock in profits while still providing downside protection. If the market reverses, the trailing stop will be triggered, closing the position and securing any gains made.
     - Do not adjust your trailing stop orders once placed.


3. Rule Three
 - **Let Profits Run** – With the instincts of a seasoned hunter, Livermore recognized that capturing the big prize required patience and persistence. He urged traders to let their profits run, maximizing gains by staying on the trail of the market's lucrative trends.
  - [x] Trailing stop orders: A trailing stop order is a type of stop-loss order that moves with the market price as it moves in your favor. This allows you to lock in profits while still providing downside protection. If the market reverses, the trailing stop will be triggered, closing the position and securing any gains made.
     - Trailing stops can be set based on a fixed price distance, a percentage, or a technical indicator such as Average True Range (ATR).
  - [x] Moving averages: Moving averages can be used as a dynamic trailing stop.
     - As the price continues to move in your favor, you can adjust your stop-loss level to the current value of a specific moving average, such as the 50-day or 100-day moving average. This allows you to stay in the trade as long as the trend is intact while protecting your gains.
  - [x] Profit targets based on technical analysis: Instead of setting fixed profit targets, use technical analysis to identify potential price levels where the market might reverse.
     - These could include key support and resistance levels
     - Fibonacci retracements or extensions
     - Chart patterns like head and shoulders
     - Double tops/bottoms
     - By setting profit targets based on technical analysis, you allow the market to dictate the duration and extent of your trade, enabling you to capture larger price moves.
  - [x] Scaling out: Scaling out of a position involves gradually exiting a trade in smaller increments as the price moves in your favor. This approach allows you to secure some profits while still keeping a portion of your position open to capture further gains if the trend continues.
  - [x] Time-based exits: In some cases, a trader might decide to let profits run for a predetermined period before exiting the position.
     - A trader could choose to hold a position for a specific number of days or weeks, or until a particular event or date.
  - [x] Trend-following indicators: Some traders use trend-following indicators.
     - The Parabolic SAR
     - The Ichimoku Cloud

4. Rule Four
 - **Patience and Timing** – Livermore likened trading success to a game of chess, where patience and timing were critical. He emphasized waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike, ensuring the odds were stacked in his favor before committing capital to a trade. By following a plan, traders can stay disciplined, avoid impulsive decisions, and wait for the right trading opportunities that fit their criteria.
  - [x] Develop a trading plan: A well-defined trading plan
     - entry and exit strategies
     - risk management rules
     - position sizing guidelines
  - [x] Focus on high-probability setups: Identify specific trading setups that have a high probability of success. Concentrate on these setups and avoid taking trades that don't meet your criteria.
     - Position sizing guidelines
     - Market Analysis 
     - Backtesting Trading Strategies
  - [x] Use limit orders: Using limit orders help improve the timing of your trades by ensuring that you only enter a trade at your desired price level. This prevents you from chasing the market or entering trades based on emotions.
  - [x] Practice mindfulness and meditation: Developing mindfulness through meditation can help traders stay calm and focused, enabling them to maintain patience and make better decisions in the face of market fluctuations.
  - [x] Avoid overtrading: Overtrading can lead to impatience. Set daily or weekly limits on the number of trades you take, or establish specific times of the day when you will trade to avoid overtrading.
     - emotional decision-making
     - reduced performance
  - [x] Set realistic expectations: Understand that not every trade will be a winner, and sometimes the market may not provide suitable opportunities. Accepting this reality can help you maintain patience and wait for the right trading setups.

5. Rule Five
 - **Manage Risk and Emotions** – In the high-stakes arena of trading, Livermore knew that courage and discipline were essential weapons. He advised traders to manage risk with stop-loss orders and position sizing, and to keep emotions like fear and greed in check to maintain a cool, calculated approach to their craft.

> Jesse rules of trading these rules offer invaluable insights into successfully navigating the markets.

Though these rules offer invaluable insights, tread with caution, for Livermore's own journey was fraught with danger and disaster. His aggressive trading strategies and lack of consistent discipline led him to multiple bankruptcies and a tragic demise. Adapt these rules to your own trading style, and heed the lessons of Livermore's tumultuous life – for within his story lies the key to unlocking the secrets of the stock market.
