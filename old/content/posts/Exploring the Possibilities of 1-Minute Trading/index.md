# Exploring the Possibilities of 1-Minute Trading

1-minute trading, also known as scalping, is a high-tempo trading strategy that involves making many trades within a short time frame. It is a popular type of day trading strategy that involves opening many small trades per hour and then adding profits and subtracting losses. These trades typically last very short, sometimes even a few minutes or seconds, depending on your objective and analysis. The goal is to make many small profits per day while limiting the amount of losses.

## What is a Scalping Strategy?

Day trading is the practice of opening multiple trades in a day. It differs from other approaches simply because day traders don’t believe in holding trades in the overnight session. They believe that doing so is a high-risk thing that will tend to lead to significant losses. 

Scalping is a relatively unique strategy in that the trader tends to open a trade and then close it within a few minutes. As such, they use very short-term charts, with a maximum size of about 5 minutes. Using longer charts in scalping will tend to lead to substantial losses because each candlestick represents a longer period.

## 1 Minute Scalping Strategies

### Trend Following

One of the most popular 1 minute scalping strategies is known as trend-following. It is a trading strategy that identifies an already-established trend and then follows it until it changes its direction. If an asset is moving in an upward trend, then you can initiate a buy trade and hope that the trend will continue. Similarly, if the stock is moving in a downward trend, you can short the asset and benefit as the price rises.

### Bullish and Bearish Flags and Pennants

Another strategy to use when scalping on a 1 minute chart is to identify an existing trend and then establish flag and pennant patterns. A flag is a pattern that has a flag pole and a rectangle type of consolidation. A pennant has a shape that looks like a triangle. These flags and pennants are usually breaks that exist during an uptrend or a downtrend. Whenever they happen, they usually end with a continuation of the existing trend.

### Other Continuation and Reversal Patterns

Another scalping strategy when you are identifying other continuation and reversal patterns in a chart. Examples of continuation patterns are ascending and descending triangles and cup and handle. When you see an ascending triangle pattern, it means that the asset’s price will likely have a bullish breakout. On the other hand, when you see a descending triangle, the likely price action will be a bearish breakout. 

Reversal patterns are double or triple top and bottom patterns. When a double-top pattern happens, the likely outcome is that the price will have a bearish breakout.

### Using the VWAP

There are many day trading indicators that you can use when scalping. One of the best one is known as the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). It is a technical indicator that seeks the overall average of an asset in a certain period of time. Unlike most other technical indicators, it is only useful in an intraday format.

## Conclusion

There are several other strategies you can use in scalping using a 1-minute chart. For example, you can use a channel strategy where you draw channels and buy when it falls to the support and short when it moves to the resistance. Another strategy is known as reversals, where you seek to identify points when an asset is about to reverse.

Beyond all these strategies, however, it is clear how much this type of charting is for the exclusive use of scalpers. And that this is perhaps the best timeframe for this category of Day Trader. It would be dangerous to analyze charts with too long intervals (30 minutes or one hour) if we are doing scalping.

So, to answer your question, yes, it is possible to trade 1-minute. It requires a specific set of strategies and a fast-paced approach, but it can be done effectively with the right knowledge and tools.
