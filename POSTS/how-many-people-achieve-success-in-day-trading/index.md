Day trading, the act of buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day, has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. However, the success rate among day traders is a topic of much debate and research. Let's delve into the statistics and studies to understand how many people do well at day trading.

## What Percentage of Day Traders Make Money?

The success rate of day traders is an elusive figure, but several studies and reports have attempted to quantify it. A study examining the profitability of 324 US-based day traders established that 64% lost money and only 36% realized profits in the duration of the study. Another paper published in the Journal of Finance in April 2000 revealed that active day traders in the United States underperformed a value-weighted index by 10.3% annually.

### The Elusive Success Rate of Day Traders: A Deep Dive
An exploration into the profitability of day traders based on the research by Douglas J. Jordan and Diltz.

 - About twice as many day traders lose money as make money.
 - Approximately 20% (or one in five) day traders are more than marginally profitable.
 - Using the trade-matching methodology, 64.2% of the traders lost money.
 - Using the flat-stock methodology, 73.4% of the traders lost money.
 - The day-trading industry often promotes the idea that day trading is an easy route to wealth, but the data suggests that being a profitable day trader is more challenging than often portrayed.

> A significant majority of day traders do not achieve profitability, with only about 20% being more than marginally successful.

In other countries, the success rate of day traders is similarly low. A study examining Taiwanese day traders found that only about 19% of all day traders made positive returns in 2011. Three years later, a concept paper by the same researchers posited that on any given day, 97% of day traders lose money net of trading fees. A study published in 2020 covering the Brazilian equity futures market established that only 1.1% of the surveyed day traders earned more than the countryâ€™s minimum wage net of fees.

## Diving Deep into Trade-Matching Methodology: A Spectrum of Outcomes

Trade-matching, a cornerstone of modern financial markets, has always been subjected to rigorous methodologies to ensure efficiency and fairness. However, recent studies and analyses reveal that the results of these methodologies can vary significantly. Factors such as market liquidity, trading volume, and the sophistication of the algorithms employed play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of trade-matching. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, it's imperative for market participants and regulators alike to understand these varied outcomes, ensuring that the trade-matching process remains robust and equitable for all involved.

### Overall Profitability
Out of a total of 324 traders analyzed using the trade-matching methodology, a significant 64.2% ended up losing money. This paints a challenging picture for those considering a venture into day trading.

### The Silver Lining: Positive Net Profit Traders
Despite the overarching trend of losses, 35.8% of traders (116 out of 324) managed to secure a positive net profit, showcasing that success, while elusive, is attainable.

### The Majority Struggle: Negative Net Profit Traders
On the flip side, 64.2% of traders (208 out of 324) faced losses, emphasizing the inherent risks of day trading.

## Flat-Stock Methodology Highlights Further Challenges

The Flat-Stock Methodology is an analytical approach used to evaluate the profitability of day traders. Unlike other methods that might consider the duration a stock is held within a trading day, the Flat-Stock Methodology assumes that trades are held overnight or even longer.

This approach provides a different perspective on trader profitability, especially when comparing it to methodologies that only consider intra-day trades. It offers insights into the performance of traders who might hold positions beyond the close of a trading day, potentially exposing them to overnight market risks.

### A Broader Picture of Profitability
When the flat-stock methodology was employed on a sample of 334 traders, the results were even more daunting, with 73.4% of traders incurring losses.

### A Glimmer of Hope: Those Who Beat the Odds
In this methodology, 26.6% of traders (89 out of 334) achieved a positive net profit. This subset of traders represents the resilience and potential success in the realm of day trading.

### The Steeper Hill to Climb: The Majority's Struggle Intensifies
A significant 73.4% of traders (245 out of 334) couldn't escape the red, further underscoring the challenges and volatility associated with day trading.

The world of day trading is fraught with challenges, and the path to profitability is steep. However, a select few manage to navigate these turbulent waters successfully. Aspiring traders should approach with caution, armed with knowledge and a clear understanding of the risks involved.


## Relationship with the Nasdaq Composite Index in "The Profitability of Day Traders"

In "The Profitability of Day Traders" by Douglas J. Jordan and J. David Diltz (Financial Analysts Journal, November/December 2003), there's a notable emphasis on the correlation between day trader profitability and movements in the Nasdaq Composite Index. The study indicates a significant positive relationship between the two, suggesting that the performance of the Nasdaq can influence the success rates of day traders.

While day trading can be profitable, it's also very risky, and a significant percentage of day traders lose money. The success rate among day traders is relatively low, with only a small percentage consistently making profits. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals considering day trading to understand the risks involved and to be well-prepared before diving in.
