 - **Criteria**: Prices that suggest a downward market trend.
### Other Columns

## 2. The Art of Drawing Lines
Drawing lines beneath recorded prices serves as a visual cue, indicating shifts between columns and potential market trend changes.
### Upward Trend to Natural Reaction
 - **Line Color**: Red
 - **Trigger**: A reaction of approximately six points from the last price in the Upward Trend column.
### Natural Reaction to Natural Rally or Upward Trend
 - **Line Color**: Red
 - **Trigger**: A rally of approximately six points from the last price in the Natural Reaction column.
### Downward Trend to Natural Rally
 - **Line Color**: Black
 - **Trigger**: A rally of approximately six points from the last price in the Downward Trend column.

### Natural Rally to Natural Reaction or Downward Trend
 - **Line Color**: Black
 - **Trigger**: A reaction of approximately six points from the last price in the Natural Rally column.
## 3. Transitioning Between Columns
The system's strength lies in its ability to predict potential market shifts based on the movement between columns.
### Natural Rally to Upward Trend
 - **Criteria**: A price that's three or more points above the last recorded price in the Natural Rally column.
### Natural Reaction to Downward Trend
 - **Criteria**: A price that's three or more points below the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column.

## 4. Pivotal Points: The Heart of the System
Pivotal points are crucial in this system. They serve as markers, indicating significant market shifts.
### Identifying Pivotal Points
The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend columns becomes a pivotal point as soon as prices are recorded in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns.
### Significance of Pivotal Points
After two pivotal points are identified, these records become invaluable in predicting the next significant market movement.
## 5. Key Price Considerations
While the system primarily uses a six-point basis for individual stocks, a twelve-point basis is applied when recording the Key Price.

Secondary columns come into play when prices don't fit the criteria for the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns. These columns offer additional insights, helping traders make more informed decisions.
### Natural Rally to Secondary Reaction
 - **Criteria**: A reaction of approximately six points, but the price isn't lower than the last figure in the Natural Reaction column.
### Natural Reaction to Secondary Rally
 - **Criteria**: A rally of approximately six points, but the price doesn't exceed the last figure in the Natural Rally column.
