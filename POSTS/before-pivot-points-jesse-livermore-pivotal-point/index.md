Before the concept of pivot points was introduced in technical analysis, Jesse Livermore had already developed his own method for identifying key price levels or pivotal points in the market. Livermore's pivotal points were based on his observation of price action, and he used these points to determine potential entry and exit points for his trades.

Livermore's approach to pivotal points relied on his understanding of market psychology and the behavior of other traders. He believed that once a stock surpassed a key price level, it would either experience a significant move in the same direction or reverse its trend. Livermore focused on the following aspects to identify pivotal points:

- [x] **Psychological barriers**: Livermore recognized that traders often placed significance on round numbers, such as $50, $100, or $200. When a stock's price approaches these levels, it could act as a psychological barrier, leading to increased buying or selling pressure.
- [x] **Breakouts**: Livermore looked for breakouts from well-defined price patterns, such as consolidation or trading ranges. When a stock's price moves beyond the established range, it could signal the beginning of a new trend or an acceleration in the existing trend.
- [x] **New highs or lows**: Livermore paid close attention to stocks that were making new highs or lows, as these could act as pivotal points where trends might change or gain momentum.
- [x] **Previous support and resistance**: Livermore also considered previous support and resistance levels as potential pivotal points. If a stock's price broke through a historical support or resistance level, it could signal a continuation or reversal of the trend.

While Livermore's approach to pivotal points was not as systematic as modern pivot point calculations, his method of identifying key price levels was rooted in a deep understanding of market psychology and price action. Today, traders can combine Livermore's insights with modern technical tools like pivot points, Fibonacci retracements, and other indicators to help identify potential turning points in the market.

**Pivotal points**, or pivot points, are a technical analysis tool used by traders to identify potential areas of support and resistance in financial markets. These points are typically calculated using the average of an asset's high, low, and closing prices from the previous trading session.

Pivot points can provide traders with key levels to monitor for possible reversals, breakouts, or trend continuations. Jesse Livermore, a legendary trader, was known for his ability to identify pivotal points in the market, even before the concept was formally developed. He would observe price action and market trends to determine potential turning points, which enabled him to make {{< linktopost url="jesse-livermore-decoding-the-genius-of-an-early-technical-analysis-visionary" alt="well-timed" >}} entries and exits in his trades.

By leveraging his understanding of pivotal points, Livermore was able to capitalize on significant market moves and achieve great success in his trading career.

### Pivotal Points And The Normal Reaction
The normal reaction to pivotal points in the market refers to the natural price fluctuations that occur around these key levels. Pivotal points are significant areas of support or resistance where market participants make decisions that can cause price reversals or trend continuations. When the price approaches a pivotal point, there is usually an increased level of market interest, leading to heightened trading activity.

 - [x] **Testing the pivotal point**: The price may test the pivotal point by moving slightly above or below it. This is when traders evaluate the strength of the support or resistance level, and some may enter or exit positions based on their assessment.
 - [x] **Reaction after testing**: After testing the pivotal point, the price may either reverse direction (bounce off the support or resistance level) or break through the pivotal point, confirming the continuation of the trend. This reaction is driven by the decisions of market participants, who either believe the pivotal point will hold or that it will be breached.
 - [x] **Increased trading volume**: The reaction to pivotal points is often accompanied by increased trading volume, as market participants take positions based on their expectations of the price movement.

The normal reaction to pivotal points can provide traders with valuable information about the strength or weakness of the market trend and help them make informed decisions about their trades. By closely monitoring these reactions, traders can identify potential trading opportunities and manage their risk more effectively.
