## 1. Recording Prices: The Basics
 - **Upward Trend Column**: Prices are recorded in black ink.
 - **Downward Trend Column**: Prices are recorded in red ink.
 - **Other Columns**: Prices in the remaining four columns are recorded in pencil.

## 2. Drawing Lines to Indicate Pivotal Points
### a. Upward Trend Column
Draw red lines under the last recorded price in the Upward Trend column on the first day you begin recording in the Natural Reaction column. This is initiated on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price in the Upward Trend column.
### b. Natural Reaction Column
Draw red lines under the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column when you start recording in the Natural Rally or Upward Trend column. This action is triggered by the first rally of about six points from the last price in the Natural Reaction column.
### c. Downward Trend Column
Black lines are drawn under the last price in the Downward Trend column when you begin recording in the Natural Rally column. This is initiated on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price in the Downward Trend column.
### d. Natural Rally Column
Black lines are drawn under the last price in the Natural Rally column when you start recording in the Natural Reaction or Downward Trend column. This is based on the first reaction of about six points from the last price in the Natural Rally column.

## 3. Identifying Trend Resumption
### a. Upward Trend Resumption
When recording in the Natural Rally column, if a price is three or more points above the last recorded price (with black lines underneath), it should be recorded in black ink in the Upward Trend column.
### b. Downward Trend Resumption
In the Natural Reaction column, if a price is three or more points below the last recorded price (with red lines underneath), it should be recorded in red ink in the Downward Trend column.

## 4. Key Price Recording
The same rules apply when recording the Key Price. However, the basis is twelve points instead of the six points used for individual stocks.

## 5. Explanatory Rules and Pivotal Points
The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend columns becomes a pivotal point as soon as you start recording in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns. After a rally or reaction has ended, you begin recording in the reverse column, and the extreme price made in the previous column then becomes another pivotal point.

## The Power of Trend Resumption Indicators
Jesse Livermore's pivot point system offers traders a robust framework to anticipate market movements. By understanding the conditions that indicate the resumption of an Upward or Downward Trend, traders can make informed decisions, capitalizing on opportunities and mitigating risks. The key lies in observing the pivotal points and the nuances of price recordings, ensuring that one is always in sync with the market's pulse.
